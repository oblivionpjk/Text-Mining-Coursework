,2020-02-29,FALSE,,,,53.9,157,5,292030,303,TRUE,"I just started playing this game on pc again after only finishing it once on console back when it first released also playing both Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine. This game has me hooked yet again, im not one to replay the same games over and over again but i like to come back to some of my favorites after awhile of not playing them. I always considered this game to be one of my favorites of all time but after playing it again i think im convinced this is my favorite of all time. It just does so many things so well. When i first played this game i hadnt yet played the first two games, although not necessary to enjoy this game it does help you understand what is going on in the story a bit more as it is a continuation of the previous games in the series. Now that i have played the first two games i feel like im enjoying the experience that much more.
The main draw to this game is obviously the story and the characters but I always see people bashing the combat in this game  but i think its actually fun. Sure its not the best of any game out there but it more than does the job and it can be very satisfying, especially when Geralt does a finishing move on an enemy, its so sick. There is also alot you can do with using potions, oils and signs to mix it up so its not just spam one button to win. I'd recommend playing on the higher difficulties so you can truly get everything out of the combat systems.
I think what this game does the best though is Incorporating all its story elements from main quests to the littlest of side quests into a massive open world game, its so well done. Its what all open world rpgs should strive to be imo, but most rarely succeed like the witcher 3 does. There is an insane amount of things to do in this game, it can kind of get overwhelming at some points but in a good way, not many games offer this much content for the money they are asking for it, this game is easily worth 60 dollars even just for one playthrough and you can get the complete edition with both massive dlcs for like half that at its normal price which is insane.
The dlc expansions in this game are also very impressive. Hearts of Stone is a good additional story to the game but Blood and Wine could literally be a whole other game itself. Its probably the best piece of dlc that you can buy in any game ever. It adds a whole new location to the game and a whole new storyline and sidequests. Its crazy it was only 20 dollars when it came out, not many developers toady will give you that much content for that low of a price. seriously its bigger than most full games that come out today like easily days of gameplay time.
Cd Project Red has to be one of if not the most respectable game developers out there, you can really tell they care about their games, theyre not out there just to milk every last cent out of people like most companies now a days. Its too bad we cant have more people like them making games. I also cant wait for Cyberpunk 2077 im sure it will be great as well ill gladly pay full price for any game they release they deserve it.
This game is in no way perfect, no game is but if somehow you havent already played this phenomenal game or you have yet to finish it i must implore that you do, It will take awhile to get through everything this game has to offer but you wont regret it.",,Majour Wafflez,,
,2020-02-29,FALSE,,,,57,157,6,292030,1444,TRUE,"Every few years, a work like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt comes along, with impressive technology and a well-written story to set the bar higher and stand as one of the greats in gaming history. This game has certainly made its impact on gaming.
It's an amazing game, one of my favorites. You follow Geralt of Rivia on his search for his surrogate daughter Ciri on a job for her actual father Emhyr var Emreis, Emperor of Nilfgaard. The game is a very deep dive into the Northern Kingdoms, their politics, the war with Nilfgaard, and general life there. The story is great, with a lot of choices available and fantastic dialogue.
The Witcher 3 is really *immersive* (yes, I know, it's a buzzword used by many games in their marketing, but this one truly feels immersive). Whether you're playing on one of the easier difficulties without any preparation for fights or use of the mechanics, or you're on Death March, with a heavy focus on things like crafting and fighting, the Witcher 3 really makes you feel like Geralt. This game has kept me playing for hours on end, not even stopping to eat. It's one of the only games that's actually immersed me so hard it distracts me from things I need to do to survive.
The art and graphics is very good, with each region feeling very different and natural. The Witcher 3 is a technical marvel in this aspect, with very good use of graphical technology in showing its world and its characters. The animations are sometimes repetitive, but you stop noticing it when you're sucked in.
The music and sound is also great. The music itself works well, and it works even better when it's combined with the world. The voice acting is good, and you never feel like you're in a game when you talk to the characters. Everything about it is incredibly memorable.
The game is very long, with several dozens of hours of a campaign, and even more in the DLCs (around 30 hours each), but it never feels boring. I'll probably be replaying this game a lot in the coming years - I simply just can't put it down and forget it.",,Lt. Thighs | Callsign - Thicc,,

Get the DLCs because more skill choices are added from the start. The map, menu, equipment, horse riding, swimming are all clunky and lack some the feature a player might want. The story, monsters, and romance carries the game along. A great world of lore to get into when you need one!

I was honestly surprised when they were coming out with The Witcher 2. I assumed the first game didn't do very well, but I was glad to be wrong. Even as one of the early adopters to the series... never did I expect the masterpeice that everything was building towards...

So this is actually my second time playing through this game, originally I picked it up upon release on PS4 and had and amazing time with it then as well. However, due to whatever reasons, I never did beat the game. So when a sale came around I decide it was finally time to pick this game back up on PC and beat it. I am extremely happy I did, the story alone it really strong and worth experiencing alone. However, the multitude of side quests and quality of these side quests are the true gem. They aren't just recycled fetch quests like you'll experience in other triple A games of this size, there's actually meat and content to side quests that other studios should take note of! (Side note, I would say 80%-90% of side quests fall into this category) Let's talk about size as well, the play area is HUGE! with, for the most part, realized areas worth exploring. This is a world you'll want to explore the nooks and crannies of as the developers did a great job of placing items of interest in remote, of the beaten path, locations. All of this is just coming from the experience of the base game all well as I've yet to touch the DLC. This game could easily still warrant a $60 price tag for the time and content, and most importantly quality of content!
With everything said so far it's time to hit on the negatives. You'll encounter bugs for sure! I have a few crashes during my play time so that's something I'd look out for and possibly change the auto save timer to 5 mins to ensure you don't lose a heavy amount of progress. Gwent as well, while not a bad aspect of it, it definitely isn't the brightest star of this game to myself and makes it a little meh that you'll have a handful of quests left over should you ignore this side of the game.

Needless to say, I had a great time. The story is pretty good, the combat is fun, and the insane amount of side content kept me going for a while. The choices you have to make in the story actually seem to have consequences and affect the story (because, well, they do). Finding a game where your choices actually have real weight to them is hard to find, and I did not expect to find that this game does that pretty well.
The Netflix series was amazing, and gave me the energy to actually complete a playthrough of the game without getting burned out. This was a phenomenal gaming experience, one that isn't for everyone, but if you are a fan of these style of games (Skyrim, other games like Skyrim because I'm just blanking right now), I highly recommend this.

(I've never written a review here, but there is so much hype around this game in late 2019, because of the TV-series, that one can be easily fooled.)
I've spent 67 hours in the game and I still haven't went to Skellige, which to my current understanding is one of the 3 main locations. So it's not a short game.
The scenes are beautiful and the changing circumstances (weather + day/night) are adding different vibes to the same area every time you would return.
Though the character model are rigid which show the age of the game, it's only disturbing in cutscenes with less clothes.
The music being dependent of the location plus the action you are doing can be repetitive if you focus on some tasks, but the single tracks are nice and helping the immersion.
Fast travel points are well placed and dense enough. This leads us to the first annoying thing in the game:
-the horse
Riding your horse meant to help you cover longer distances faster. Taking into account the distance between fast travel posts and how disturbingly buggy it is to call the horse, this becomes a big trouble. The main beauty of the game would be to roam the wild. Instead you spend a minute to get on your horse whistling the whole time, because sometimes it appears under a bridge, in the bridge, stuck in the woods or not at all. You start running to not waste more time and to give another chance to Roach to spawn to a better spot. Then either your reach a fast travel point and miss out half of the game or you mount your horse, become three times more powerful as on foot and slay any monster. Then of course you have to get off the horse to loot some monster blood and you can only wish that you are on a nice open field where Roach can not face an unmovable tree and dash it endlessly.
Another engine bug which can ruin you experience are:
-hints
More like the lack of them. There are basic elements in the game and some I missed out completely because I got a short message about it when I was past level 15. Alchemy was on topic and not only I didn't focus on this, but as a side effect I have also no skills purchased for it. The reason for this is that I tried to play this section of the game without it's help so I compared it to Oblivion, and this one is just far more because so I was overthinking. That game is making a lot more things right for example:
-stealing/looting
This is just a small annoyance to some, but I was used to in Oblivion that you can only freely steal from anyone if you worked hard and became a master thief. This feature is missing here, which means you walk into the house of the poorest family, your best friend or greatest foe and start looting dried fruits from all the cupboards. No one bats an eye, no chill, no fun and feels pretty awkward and morally questionable at the beginning.
But all the previous issues are small disturbances and could be forgiven, not the:
-leveling
I hope there is a well defined sequence you can play this game in a challenging, enjoyable way. But I must beg to differ. The early part was incredibly frustrating and then suddenly easy on that degree that you start questioning why would you start any mission. Why is that? Every task has a suggested level assigned to it. As well every combat item has a minimum level that you can use it. So if you are getting bored following the main quest and want to do some good old hack and slash you head to the woods. Then you realize how under powered you are and try to buff up a little bit. This is the point when it becomes clear making a two minute conversation with someone in a quest where you make 2 ""decisions"", which are changing a single line in the text from you partner gives you the same amount of XP as killing +4 level beasts for a couple of hours. Reaching level 7 from level 6 took hours, I couldn't wait to be able to use my new sword I saved money for. Then I popped into the city to speed up the process and left level 15, the sword being a garbage sold for 5 golds... The monsters I was struggling with earlier couldn't even slow me down and I have a list of side quest above my level giving 1-2 xp and offering no challenge at all. I even missed out a big chunk of the story as I was sent to north which I followed literally instead of the detour to the east which was foreseen by the writers, but the blockade which you I should have dealt with was only effective there not the other way leading to the destination city.
Now I'm in a world where I can kill dragons with my pinky in one forest and could be teared apart from level 40 wolves in another, having 3 different main storylines which contradict each other(working for someone in one, while I'm planning to kill the person in another). I already have failed mission because I finished another earlier and the player I should have interact with is not available anymore.

is the minigame which kind of confirms, that this is happening not by mistake, but by design. The first rounds you just have no chance. Then there is still tiny little period when you have to make an effort to be successful. The fun part, which is challenging and therefore rewarding. It's not impossibly hard and not blatantly easy. Then you win a few games and it's over. You have such a strong deck, you don't even have to try, you just win and start the grinding, to fast travel to locations search more unique cards, win them in two minutes and restart the cycle.",7.66E+16,ruppi,,

I personally watched the series first, read the books then played this games since it's a ""sequel"" to the former mediums.
I recommend taking time to play this game properly, because one can rush it in 40 hours while you can play it for at least a 150 hours and still get pleasant surprises.
This is the only game where the side quests are as good as the main story.
The DLCs are absolutely phenomenal and are better than other standalone RPG or AAA games in their entirety.
Having read the books, seeing the characters and the truly rich and detailed world come to life altogether was very pleasant. The Witcher's word is grim but authentic and beautiful at the same time and countless times I have found myself admiring the amount of efforts the devs put into this by meticulously studying Andrezj Sapkowsky's books.
I've played many RPGs but this is by far the best one I've ever played.
Great story
Great combat
Insanely beautiful world and lore

The story is rich and has great character development, really giving you an emotional attachment to characters that I haven't seen from a game of this nature before. The combat is far better than I had even expected, forcing you to use all of the tools at your disposal from your swords to your abilities and potions. The combat has a ton of depth, and a really high skill ceiling if you manage to practice at it- giving you a huge degree of satisfaction when defeating powerful enemies and bosses. The sheer number of unique monsters and enemies types (including bosses) is insane, and shockingly never gets tedious or repetitive. The loot and crafting is the best I've seen from an RPG, as it is deep but not tedious to find the materials you need.
Definitely the closest game I've played to a 10/10- if you're on the fence, definitely pick it up. Throw in some mods like I did for a few quality of life changes, and this becomes a 10.",,Mountain,,

Very few RPG's these days live up to the name, they just pretend to, Witcher 3 on the other hand...
PROS
Your choices actually matter - A lot of games with 'choice based' story mechanics only give you the mere illusion of what you say on that dialogue wheel actually matters towards the end goal, like Skyrim or Fallout 4; Not Witcher 3, I was shocked when I got the bad ending my first time through.
Even though you don't necessarily make your character in this game, you make his decisions, and even though you don't form his face in a character creator menu, Geralt feels a lot more like YOURS than any Skyrim character of yours ever will.
The Story has grit - There's rarely good or bad in this game, like I mentioned before your actions have consequences...
You kill a dog to save a boy, the wolf pack for you, you kill a boy to save a dog the whole village is after you.
The gameplay is genuinely fun -
The whole role-playing bit, this game pretty much hits right on the money, no doubt; What about the gameplay part? Well the action is no place to complain either i think.
Sure i've had those ""I dodged over there, not over there!"" moments or the ""I didn't mean to take that potion!"" moments, But! It's well rounded, obviously taking influence from the Dark Souls series of games like every other action Action RPG these days but can you really argue? It works and it's fun.
The game doesn't force you to play any specific way. You don't have to use potions, concoctions, or bombs, but if you do, you'll find it completely rewarding when you've planned an epic battle beforehand and find yourself completely ripping through enemies thanks to it.
If you plan right you can turn a challenging battles into a breeze, and it's only because you've prepared yourself.
None of this will be as satisfying though if you don't play on blood and broken bones difficulty... ahem... let me repeat myself... PLAY ON BLOOD AND BROKEN BONES... or death march if you like being pegged...
CONS
Horse jank - Your horse, Roach, can be a lil éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ«éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ«éˆ?at times. Sometimes he has a hard time doing a 360. Resting your horse to regain stamina is a bit gay... but by NO means whatsoever does this take away from how badass this game is deep in. By the end you'll end up naming your next Minecraft horse Roach anyways so what does it matter...
Geralt jank - You move like a robot. What can i say this whole game feels like it's on ice; It's irritating at times but i've never felt like punching a whole through my monitor. ledges are éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ«éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ«éˆ¾î™«s, fight near water you probably dodge and find your self in the middle of the ocean, and getting on boats is like putting on pants two legs at a time...
IN CONCLUSION
THIS GAME IS GREAT...
The cons are so minor they're practically non-problems and the pros far outweigh any issue you can throw at it.
You'll fall in love with Geralt and his friends, regardless if you had played the last two games or not, I know I didn't. So finally, I recommend that you steal you parents credit card as soon as possible, and hop into this beautiful, beautiful experience as quickly as you can...",,bube_,,

éˆ½æ‰™XTREMELY BUGGY. One of actually no, this is the most buggy game I've played in recent years. A list of some of the few hundred bugs I encountered were: Crashing, loading screens not ending, enemies being stuck in a T pose and easy to kill, falling through the map, not being able to use signs unless you reload, potions not going off and the worst one I came across by far is Level Scailing. TURN THIS OFF! As even RATS can one shot you if you reach a certain level which is absolutely ridiculous and certain fights like the Djinn one becomes impossible with it on if you are a higher level then the quest
éˆ½æ‰¤oticed in dialogue, if you choose an option rarely Geralt doesn't exactly say what you picked just either along the lines of it barely or not relating to it at all. Very rare this happens but noticed it a couple times playing it through twice
éˆ½æ‰–rafting is VERY expensive late game, so expensive you have to keep finding ways to farm money if you don't have contracts left and want to keep crafting gear/weapons by killing high level enemies and selling their weapons which doesn't always work as smiths have a set amount of money which can run out if you sell them too much
Overall this is a phenomenal game I would arguably say is better then Zelda: BOTW, but bugs hold it back by a lot. In BOTW there is a lot of great ones like launching across the map riding your shield or beating the game from the get go but in this game, the bugs are ONLY an annoyance always hindering your gameplay.

The story is rich with characters, the dialogue is pretty good, character models are outstanding, and overall a must have, especially on sale. There is so much to do, even without the DLCs. I really cant say anything else new that hasn't already been praised by millions of other people. Just get the game.
There are some downsides. Since there are huge maps, there is a lot of walking, not Borderlands worth of walking, but its a lot. Luckily you can ride your trusty horse Roach around. The crafting is a little intricate, you'll be picking up loads of leaves and herbs, but not end up using most of em for the good stuff. The inventory is pretty decent though, so its makes up for that.

There are multiple endings, but they depend on what you chose to do at a handful of points in the game. None of the key moments seemed particularly weighty at the time, and the options you are given all seem pretty random, meaning that the various options don't conform to one or another moral/ethical worldview. You make a more or less random choice and you don't find out the consequences until the the game's final cutscene. But this is really a small criticism, or easy to forgive and forget. The game is very deep, has tons of customization of your boy Geralt in both gear and skills. The only other minor quibble is that sometimes combat, especially unarmed combat, is more exhausting for the player (you) than it seems to be for Geralt. Spamming the block and strike buttons for long fights made me worried about carpal tunnel syndrome. Maybe there are better approaches, but I never found them.

,2020-02-23,FALSE,,,,58.6,225,6,292030,85,TRUE,"I bought this game thinking, ""great, finally a game all about witches"". However, it turns out it is in fact not entirely about witches, despite there being several witches throughout the game. Before you finish letting out that long sigh of disappointment, let me assure you, it is very much so a game about witches.
The game centers around Geralt of Rivia, a 'witcher' who struggles with his identity after being forced to conform to his adoptive family's witcher teachings from a young age, despite self-identifying as a witch. After years of psychological torture and identity crisis, he has come to terms with who he is. Geralt now seeks to break the cycle of identity norms that had both physically and mentally altered his life forever, by finding his old apprentice Ciri and letting her know it's okay to pursue her destiny as a witch. Although there's only several witches throughout the game on your journey to find Ciri, there's plenty of great filler content along the way, including all of the creatures you'd expect in a great witch game like ghouls, imps, werewolves, and ghosts. Now I know what you're thinking, no witch game would ever be complete without magic and potions, and you're right. Thankfully, this game has you covered despite their non-traditional approach. Although Geralt still frequently uses magic, it is not his primary catalyst for destruction as with a typical witch. Nor does he require a cauldron to brew potions or a spell book to cast his spells, but we have the witcher teachings to blame for this. Sadly, the one thing that's definitely missing from this game is the ability to fly, but I'm afraid the witcher teachings have ruined this possibility as well; although to be honest, I'm personally convinced this is solely the result of laziness on the developer's part, but I digress.
Despite needing some work in the witch department, it's probably the closest thing us fans have to a witch game for now. Overall, I'd give it a 10/10 for its endless hours of content, remarkable RPG decisions/consequences, solid combat system, and its resemblance of a witch game. If you are one of those people who aren't expecting this game to be entirely about witches, I'm sure you'll have fewer issues with the game and I would 100% recommend it.",7.66E+16,StinkyFist,,

Visually, the game is gorgeous. If you've got a high-end PC, crank up those graphics and enjoy all the work that went into making the world. You're in for a treat.
The story and the mechanics, I think, are going to depend a lot more on you as an individual.
The story begins with you attempting to find Ciri and Yen. Yen is found fairly quickly, while finding Ciri is a much larger quest. As for myself, I've just never been able to muster much enthusiasm for Ciri as a character or how Geralt interacts with her. This takes a lot of the wind out of the sails of the main storyline very quickly. The side quests range from brilliant to incredibly boring and mundane, and it can be hard to tell which are going to be which.
Combat is very showy, but still feels a bit stilted, as it did in the first two games. Some people don't mind this or even enjoy it, but I found it causing a lot of problems in terms of my being able to get into the flow of a fight. There is a ton of stuff for your to craft, if that's something you enjoy, but I found that it generally didn't bring much satisfaction for me and often felt fairly fiddly for minor gains.
Gwent is another large feature of the game, and if you enjoy the card game, there is a lot of possibly enjoyment to be had from playing and building the deck, but it was another spot for myself where I just found myself not really enjoying the process much and wondering why I was doing this.
At the end of the day, I'd say this is a AA studio that managed to produce a AAA game. But my problem is that I find AAA games to feel largely kind of bland and lifeless and the fact the it came from a AA studio who couldn't quiet put the resources into polishing and detailing the mechanics like AAA studios do, end up doing it a disservice. If your primary play and enjoy AAA game studio products, this is absolutely worth a buy. It's a chance to see how smaller developers make up for their lack of money to blow on the strength of stories and making strong mechanical systems that create interesting game play loops.
If you're primarily an Indie Game or AA studio supporters, your mileage may vary. It can often times feel like a game design to be much smaller, instead spread out and stretched thin over too much game time. If can often times feel like a story that should have been better that was watered down a bit for mass appeal. But the core systems are still strong, perhaps just not as strong as they could have been.
I'm giving this game a thumbs down for me, but that's just out of recognition that it isn't really a game designed for people like me. Not because it's a poor game.",,Action Bastard!,,

The DLC's are great editions adding around 30 hours onto the main game in my case. Blood and Wine is more fantasy oriented with lots of story references, Toussaint is the best looking area followed by Skellige. Heart of Stone's story has some impactful moments through it but feels like a bit more of a grind until you start to uncover real truths towards the end.
Overall, I played this game like a completionist to begin with but with the shear amount of map content and side missions this becomes very difficult and you tend to go with the flow at your own comfortable rate.
This is hands down the best individual game i have ever played, even though it took several years for me to come around and finish it.

How many times you've received recommendation of a game and red critics that praise it, and then played it just to find it's even better than the critics says? This is the rare and wonderful scenario with the Witcher 3.
Although coming with the highest expectations, the quality of the game caught me of guard, surprised of how it perfected the modern gaming experience. 'Why' you ask? what is so good about it?
It's not tons of gamers follow as sheep, praising it because its popular to, the truth is that the Witcher excel every category -
Incredible graphics and design, that would make it a thrill to explore, full of HUGE amount of content, events and adventures to make your life feel boring without, super solid RPG elements crafted wisely, breathtaking soundtrack, intriguing gameplay and animations, and if that's not enough, and most important in the gaming world now days -
Magnificent story telling - not because its unique, but because every character lives and breathes through dialogue and great voice acting, using a well detailed script which give every one of them the complex and sense of realism, that would make you care for so many of them.
This game is so packed with areas and quests, endless options and decision to make, and what you choose is going to take effect, so you should always keep that in mind.
If I'd try to find points to improve (I needed to search so much for it) - The RPG core of the game, that is a bit overflowed and maybe overdone containing amount of items and elements to deal with, feels so many times scattered and overwhelming not in a good way, and you won't feel like going over so many of them, and ignore a lot of items.
But if it's the only thing that wasn't perfect, who am I to complain?
To sum up - I don't have lot of patient for endless RPG's, but 192 HOURS ON RECORD just flew by! Anything left to say?
Thank you, CD Project Red, for changing the life of countless gamers!

Using the boat has got to be one of the most tedious and boring parts of the experience, that's one part of the game I tried to avoid as best I could. For a person like myself, who likes making sure all of the maps in games I play are filled out, I stopped checking each question mark after I realised that the majority of them, especially in Skellige (specifically the ones on water) are absolutely useless. There is little to no incentive to collect loot for any reasons other than selling it as your Witcher gear will always be better than anything you come across. This ruins any satisfaction I would have with exploring this otherwise very beautiful and immersive world. There just doesn't seem to be a priority in throwing a bone at the player for curiosity and adventure, which is present in many other games of this and previous generations...
There are still many things I can't remember off the top of my head, however despite all its flaws I still stuck through with the game as the highs in quests and storytelling certainly do reach a high peak in certain parts. I'll be lying if I said I didn't immensely enjoy the stories told in the Witcher 3. It's definitely the strongest part of the game - the writing and interesting characters.
If you love western RPGs or action RPGs then you've already played this game. If you don't know what a WRPG/ARPG is, then this is an easy choice to pick up to try out as a first. I find this game quite simple once you learn a few intricate parts such as potion management and properly casting signs.",,Varkster,,

Released a couple of years ago already, although some mechanics or graphics are not so good compared to current games, it is still on par with many major games released recently, and better than most others!
It is an open world, with a amazing main story plot, tons of interesting side quests, ruins and things to explore, monsters to kill everywhere, things like armor sets and cards to collect, and many more!
It's almost an experience, one that can only be understood after you've played it.
It's my third playthrough, and the story and quests still are exciting and refreshing. Oh, and the decisions you make do matter!

,2020-02-21,FALSE,,,,536.4,249,1,292030,185,TRUE,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, other than Earthbound, is the game I've put most hours into. 522 at the time of this review. It's a really impressive game for what it is, a sequel to 2 rather éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ«éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ«éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ«?games (imo). The open world is one of the best in gaming, only beaten out by Zelda Breath Of The Wild. But this sadly is not a great achievement like it might sound like. Most open worlds in games are pretty bland and boring with billions of things to that are all the same at the end of the day. Though this world feels more alive and interesting than those other ones, it's still cursed with rather boring tasks like killing bandits in their camp, or in an abandoned village, or monsters in a cave and monsters in their nests. All which reward pretty useless stuff.
The combat also lacks, once you get a hang of it. Dodge, attack and repeat endlessly it gets easy as éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ«éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ«. Even on death march. The hardest difficulty. Though the swift moves and dance like sword play is pretty fun at times like when meeting humanoid enemies.
Where The Witcher really shines, and I mean REALLY shines, is at the side quests. They are by far the best I've ever played through. Almost all have really unique and fun stories attached to them and most hide that they're fetch quests rather well. Highlights for me are Where the Cat and Wolf Play (Free dlc quest) and Carnal Sins.
Speaking of DLC, both expansions are very good, Hearts of Stone being the best of the two, but Blood and Wine providing most of the content will bring you most of the playtime when comparing the two. There is also free DLC like quests and other addons that are circlejerked to oblivion and beyond. Sure they are cool, Cat and Wolf is a highlight. But not more special than free content other devs add to their games. So why it's a ""plus"" when people recommend the game to others is something I don't really understand. The free DLC can be skipped and not much would be missed (other than cat and wolf of course)
Graphics are good but sound is odd and feels off at times. Everytime the Wild Hunt is on camera, it sounds like the most dramatic of sound effects were added to a guy getting of a horse. The inns also have this weird crowd noise when it's like two people in there. There are plenty of other sound issues but none that really bother me. Soundtrack is also rather meh.
I might sound negative in this review which is odd as I'm recommending it, but this game is still so éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ«éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ«ing good even though it has some flaws. I was never really bored when playing and the immersion levels were through the roof. I really recommend you play this game atleast once, including it's DLC. You can get plenty of hours out of this beast. I would say around 70 your first time around.
Also Gwent is bad, fight me. Yes it's a minigame but it has éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ«éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ« balance. If you have an okay deck you'll never lose, and I mean NEVER.

Story goes actually like this...
Find Ciri. Find Ciri. Find Ciri... ok, why do I have to find Ciri again? I already forgot...
Who knows about Ciri? No idea. Ok, let's ask a witch... she knows nothing. Ok, let's ask someone else. He knows nothing. Once you find a guy who knows something about Ciri, he won't tell you. He wants favour A and B and C and then only he tells you. So you go around and around and around and do all kind of favours for all kind of people... not, that these have to do anything with the actual main story. Nada.
Ok, so once you do all kind of favours for Guy A he tells you what you know about Ciri. And where is she now? He has no clue. Why the heck did I had to do all this, I'm actually no further. So, you start over again. The whole thing starts from beginning. Go to another place and ask all kind of people to see who knows something about Ciri. Finally, another Guy B knows something but he won't tell you either, because he too wants favours from you .... and so the whole  thing keeps repeating and keeps repeating and keeps repeating.
Wait... why did we do all this in the first place? By the time you're done with all the favours, it's no wonder, you've forgotten why that even mattered... after all, you're only doing things for others and nothing is for you.
You realize, your character is actually boring. The actual storyline could also not matter to you at all (not like in Skyrim, where YOU are DRAGONBORN), after all, you have no emotions anyway as everyone says, so effectively, you do not truely care about others.
You realize, The Witcher 3 has actually nearly no story at all... if you remove all the noise. Take just a handful of the loading cutscenes in between and the true _main_ story is told. The rest, noise which is unimportant.",,kdimi11,,

The only RPGs that come near this for me are Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Persona 5, Fallout 1 & 2, and JRPGs like Chrono Trigger and old Final Fantasy. So, in other words, RPGs that are almost nothing like The Witcher 3.
Note that I originally played this on PS4 before I got a good PC and used a save file to start my PC game with the main questline complete, so I've actually played for around 200 hours, something I've never done with any other game.
I'm not saying it's perfect, it's not. But it tries so much more than any other game and gets basically everything right. Except for that ****** fall damage. Speaking of small annoyances that are easily fixed with mods, there also lots of solid mods! My personal favorite is Immersive Cam by KCS.

When it came out on switch I bought it and gave it another shot but on the go. I gave it more of my time and really payed attention to the games story and great details and it has been a great journey to see. I have not used many of the games great deep systems such as oils or potions to make my life easier I really enjoyed the story and some challenge but even without this the game still feels deep and if you want to use those you can but I didn't meaning its an option not needed to have fun. Granted the game has some flaws like there are so many characters that you can't care for them all some you need to help and while doing that you can't wait for the mission to be over. Loot seems to be you need to find it early or don't craft anything as exploring as a few levels higher causes your gear to be better than anything you can find, BUT it makes really good stuff to sell such as swords that are hundreds of crowns. If you complete all the side missions as they come and often explore all the question marks on the map you obtain many weapons and armor if you sell that You won't need to worry of money like me having always more than 15 thousand without really trying and just spending when I want on crafting my gear. I will say nothing about the story other than I liked it you need to believe you are Geralt and shouldn't do anything he wouldn't like being with a woman even though he loves someone else and  this can cause negative things later in game. By playing slow it really is slow I have played for hours exploring and getting like 50 EXP but less than a full main mission gives 500 EXP normally, contracts and side missions never give the same amount of EXP like a main mission but it can give at one time a few hundred crowns or an item worth selling and crowns or a good item (good item isn't too often) the side mission never really feel the same other than maybe doing looking around with your senses but thats what makes a witcher. Combat is very rewarding like when using a good spell in the mix or not getting hit or the finishers that cut limbs off of enemies is really cool to watch. Crafting is defintly a friend being if you don't craft then you won't be at full potential and the things to craft isn't hard to come by if you kill and loot all your monsters then that is fine or if its something that can be bought at a merchant with your thousands of crowns. I still have more to do like the DLCs but if anything else comes to mind that I wish to add I will edit to give a better review to anyone that is thinking of this game. If your on the fence then don't buy it now wait for a sale or the time this is a game that requires many hours and full attention you need to give it a shot as it throws many things at you right out the gate. If you will give it the time and are on the fence it is a good game I have no clue about your game standards but I enjoy open world games and it is a good one. If you wish to try it steams refund policy is great just set a timer for about and hour and a half so you can stop the game and make a decision. It should give you the main set up within the first 90 min so you can see if it is something you enjoy. I would not recommend if this is a game that will be boughten than never played like me the first time, to enjoy you need to listen and make the right choices to have a connection to the characters and story and the world.  It says I have played the game on steam for about 19 hours that not including switch in a recent update it allows me to play on my switch on the go then at home continuing the same save on PC but on my switch I have roughly 70 hours. I hope you have reached the end of this and that I have been able to help you in buying this game or seeing if it was right for you.",,Pinleech,,

The story is kinda interesting, but not for me really.
If you like rich story games but are slightly impatient, you will hate this game.
There are a lot of other basic things that I hate about the game.
The unnecessary amount of overlay destroys the athmosphere.
From a game which puts a lot of work into athmosphere and design,
you would expect that NPCs are decently reacting realistically,
But sometimes they just do not care about the fact
that some of their companies just died and completely ignore it.
You go into a bar and because you saved the son of the tavern keeper, she says that you can buy stuff for free,
but then it doesn't apply practically. You still have to buy stuff.
Yeah, it would be too easy, but also realistic.
Sometimes, Mods walk into each other in conversations with the player,
NPC reaction animations do not change over fluently, makes them look like crazy witches.
Unrealistic destroyed villages: Usually, you would not see armies leaving behind some villagers, rather than enslaving, killing or éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ«éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ«éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ«?them. The same goes for buildings or the only single coat of arms in the middle of the village.
More realistic would have been half dead or completely dead villagers. Anything but this.

I don't think there is any other game like this that you can just play for top 14 hours a sitting and not get bored once.
A game that is never unengaging, always keeps you intrested on something.
If it runs well its the graphics holds up to this day, and I would say where it comes to clothing its one of the best till this day, just the amount of detail is insane
A game so dark, beautiful and poatic at once...
Some people think this game is not for everyone, thats correct, not for everyone that does not have time to waste, but I think if some just try to play the game right and get the graphics done, I think 95% of them would just fall in love with this master piece.
150 minimum hours of gameplay including DLCs, 4 maps with each more then a 100 things to be doing AND its bloody cheap on steam, but theres a reason why people are wanting to pay full price.

This game is one of the most mesmerizing, electrifying, phenomenal RPGs I've ever got to play.
During my run-down on my Game of the Decade (for entertainment purposes), I couldn't help but return to Geralt in this beautiful story-rich game.
You aren't a hero desperately trying to save the world, nor a villain waiting for it to decay. You are Geralt of Rivia, a monster-hunting witcher with a personal journey of finding your surrogate daughter, Cirilla.
You will come across a desolate, realistic world filled with complex, mature story lines and themes awaiting the players who decide to ignore their real-life responsibilities in order to live through Geralt with the potential
What, personally, puts the
in front of every other open-world RPG title is that each and every distraction from the main quest feels meaningful and impactful rather than an empty map-event. In an age where countless developers seem to fill their games with repetitive side-quests and boring events with no consequences, itéˆ¥æªš undoubtedly refreshing to see worthwhile content brimming from potentially the biggest open-world game ever.
Whether youéˆ¥æª™e new to the series or a Witcher saga veteran, youéˆ¥æª’l continue to learn new things about Geralt and his world as time goes on, allowing your game-play to feel fresh every step of the way.
Kudos to CD Project RED for this masterpiece.

First of all, I've heard of this game since 2018 when i first got my laptop. I know this game because it is always on the top sales.2 years later, I bought this game last week and spent 122 hours to finish the game on Blood and March Difficulty, discovered most of the question mark on the map, finished both DLC, upgraded all my weapons and finished with a satisfying ending.
Pros of this game:
- Thick plot and very interesting story line, got attached to the story line right after i finished the Baron quest, awful ending but understand happy ending exists only in fairy tail.
- Good combat system, thought the camera angle is not really fully developed but it is great than you can dodge and roll, cast spell, bombs, crossbows, parry, counterattack. Various of combat styles is the unique part of being a witcher, two swords but the combat style is always different.
- Balance Enemy system, there's an upscaling button in the game which you can witch off or on, enhance the game experience as the previous monsters are not easily defeated when you're on higher level. Besides, you can always challenge some of the higher level enemies using specific skills and spells, not to say it is guaranteed that you will win but proud to slay a witcher contract which is not on your level.
- Travel system, in an open world game traveling is the most unpopular option for most of the players, fast travel is preferred because it actually saves a lot of time. There are tons of marker on the map which you can discover and never have to travel again.
- Crafting System seems good as there is filters, ingredients that are needed for alchemy or crafting can be pinned and will highlighted in a white box whenever you visits the shop.
Dismantle is the key in saving a lot of time for the resources needed in some crafting.
- Graphics, simply awesome and you will most definitely felt like you're in Velen, Novigrad, Toussaint and Skillige. There are epic views such as sunset, mountains, ruins, castle and so on.
Cons of this game:
- UI for inventory, from my opinion, this inventory looks like something from the warcraft time. It is not bad but there's room to improve.

Simply put those are not the type of game for me, i can get a few hours of enjoyment but then i lose interest, the story doesnt hold me, the gameplay gets repetitive, i dont care about the world im playing within.
With that said this game has sat in my steam library for probably 3 years picked up on sale without being played, for the exact above statements.  Sure I heard all the rave reviews but its just not my type of game right? Well i was so very very wrong. I am sure like many of you after watching the TV series my interest was once again peaked. I always wanted to start with witcher 1 and 2 but I could never make it farther than an hour or two in, the TV series gave me enough background info that I felt able to simply skip those games and I am sure glad I did. The story and world crafted in the game is leagues above anything else I have ever played. The sheer amount of things you can do, decisions you can make, side quests that appear simply by just walking down a city ally and being approached by a stranger that leads to a detailed intricate line of quests. It is all perfectly crafted to make a living world with characters and stories you honestly care about. Take my advice if anything about this story peaks your interest, and even if you are like me who could never seem to make it more than a few hours in to an open world game.

Maybe not because it has the best combat, or the most freedom of choice, not even the best graphics maybe?
But everything it has, is polished and well executed, and everything is in harmony.
The aspects i could take are:
- Gameplay: Simple mechanic of two buttons + spells, while also having the two swords. It would seem it's narrow, but the variety of enemies make you use the simple mechanics in A LOT of ways to defeat the great variety of enemies. It has really well done bosses and fights.
- Graphics: Polished and very beautifully crafted. It might not have the most realistic graphics for that year even, but it has a lot of detail, good lightning and textures.
- Bugs: In 2020, i can say they have patched them into oblivion.
- Story: It's a damn good story, but it has a downside. The main antagonists are not very well explained and shown. We don't know them enought to really have THAT impact. Everyone else in the story though, they have their share of background.
A very well executed and polished game, which is even today a standard for the genre.
I have only played the Main Story, and i'm eager to play the DLC soon.

There is surely no game that can top this one and it's to stay that way for a long time.
This game is practically perfect. Of course, when you make a game you can't reach perfection, not everyone will love this game, some people prefer Fortnite for instance.
But ! if you actually like good games, then this game is just for you.
This game was clearly designed for people who have good tastes, you won't make a normie play this game
but let me tell you more about the game. For this review is not about normies that have sh*t tastes but about the masterpiece that is The Witcher 3.
You play as Geralt of Rivia a Witcher. A Witcher is a monster slayer, a mutant. They have extreme strength and reflexes and use potions to get even stronger. And you follow his story, make impactful choices that change the course of the game and of course, slay monsters for coin.
The game has awesome graphics and was released in 2015. The gameplay is phenomenal. And the story... Oooh the story !
The story is perfect and the characters are amazing ! even the most despicable ones, the mean guys who make horrible actions are well written and you almost love them. Of course you don't love them for their evil side, you love them because the writing is perfect.
but let's rate the game now...
10/10 perfect game, perfect graphics, perfect story, perfect everything.

,2020-02-17,FALSE,,,,195.7,286,4,292030,76,TRUE,"This is THE best RPG i have played, the reasons for me making this claim are not without evidence.
One of the main reasons is the story which is jaw dropping, from white orchard to the swampy areas of Velen to the renowned city of Novigrad to the Great Witchers keep of Kaer Morhen, each area has its own decisions that will impact the way your story goes.
The game also has excellent replayability as the game has so so many choices, these range from impacting your game at the moment or in the far future, what build will you go, who will you side with, it can even be what hairstyle you want.
Second, is that the artstyle is still breathtaking to this day, from the monsters, buildings, people, and much more. All these things mend together to immerse you into the games astonishing setting and atmosphere. One thing i feel could have been improved apon was the hair.
Third, is the witcher contracts. this is because the witcher contracts arent just go here and kill this, they each have there small storys in them witch is just a +1 in the replayability of the game
Fourth is the gameplay in my opinion it is a huge improvement compared to the witcher 2, which had cluncky combat mechanics in my opinion, also in the Witcher 3 each fight seemed to have a soul as the excellent combat mechanics were woven with the incredible music of the witcher 3.
Fifth is the music, this is because no matter where you are, this could be, standing, running, riding, sailing, or fighting the music has a way to throw you into the beautiful but harsh world of the Witcher 3.
Last is the difficulty of the game, if its your first time and you just want the story than theres a difficulty for that, where as if you want a difficult challenge you can go DM (Death March) as i did and turn on upscaling
So this is the end of my review, i could keep going on about diagrams and more but i have laid out the main points in my opinion.",,Communist_Comrade,,

1-Story telling: The strongest point by far of witcher 3 is easily its story telling. When side quest have better storyline and more engaging that 90% of rpgs main stories out there, you know you are in for a treat. Seriously, some of theses quests will haunt you.. in a good way, for a long long time.
2- World building: Red dead redemption came pretty much equal but only theses two games have such a believable world, you think its real.
3- Real choices and real consequences: You are not playing good or evil... forget this stupid concept. Like real life, you make choices and theses choices have consequences.. The consequences can be good according to you or evil according to your best friend... It is all but perception. You save a guy one day only to find out he was a criminal the second day? You let someone of dubious morale die and you find out the next day he could have cured cancer? Well, you do not know and you will not see it coming in witcher 3 either.  You make choices all the time.. so much it becomes very difficult to know when one will change the ending or does not change much in the end... and this is en excellent feeling. It feel real, it feel true.
In witcher 3, you might be in a puppet show but not once will you see the strings. Enjoy the ride.

this game is good",,2x4 Pine Plank,,
,2020-02-17,FALSE,,,,107.8,287,5,292030,107,TRUE,"OK, I've been hesitant as to how to really understand what  keeps me playing this game, because at times it's as open and interesting as Fallout, and other times it seems like it was written by a group of 13-year-olds really into Dungeons and Dragons. Ultimately I can say this, it's a fun game and worth slogging around in. BUT, if you're a veteran gamer, there are more plot holes and logic gaps than are really tolerable.
In general this is a vast improvement on the previous  Witcher games. The controls are good, the menus feel more comfortable, and the dozen plus keyboard shortcuts give this a hearty PC feeling, unlike the previous 2 games with felt like grinding console ports. There are some fantastic towns, ruins, caves, and terrain. In 54 hours of game play there are less than 5 interesting NPC's. That's the heart of the problem, right there.
Witcher 3 is a huge world, with hundreds of people, dozens of animals, even more monsters, a smooth combat system with great brutal kill effects. The story limps along with numerous distractions, the inconsistent idea of the nature and demeanor of a Witcher distracts from the character, and frequent lack of conversation options gets annoying. There are several times already that a major story plot is gaffed into something that makes very little sense, but the story moves on, leaving the mess behind without consequence. Not an error, not a glitch, just a lazy decision to leave something out that could explain what happened, rather than a ""Nothing to see here, move along"" feeling.
However, if you played games like Icewind Dale, Diablo, Fallout, or Grand Theft Auto V, you can find a big world to explore, things to do, and even find a few really amazing moments that are truly unique. However, if you want a story that's really going to grip you and not let go, this probably won't do the job. It's not F.E.A.R. or Half-Life. Granted, I'm old, but I really want something more from a game. Witcher 3 just seems half-finished, lacks focus, and ultimately falls short on making a really good game about ghosts and monsters and the mystic warrior who hunts them, instead flirting with confusing politics, loose magic rules, and far too many flat and boring quests from bland characters. Too bad.",,Apolyon,,

Yeah there are a lot, but you don't have to select every dialogue if you don't want (it highlights the main ones in yellow).  Besides, I am finding the cut scenes to be absolutely amazing and hardly ever want to skip them!  If I do, I just read the sub-titles and then it allows me to hit space to skip.  Honestly though, I am not one to usually want to read everything but this game is making me want to since the story is so good.  I am finding myself reading all the books, reading about all the characters, and the beastiary.  The whole story and game is immersive and the way you have to use your Witcher senses and learn about your enemies to know to use against them is outstanding.  The fighting is very good, the magic is fun to use, and the monsters are awesome.
Simply an outstanding game. I hope they come out with another one after I finish this one.  If you are on the fence, just go ahead and buy it, I guarantee you won't be disappointed.  This game really makes me feel like I am the Witcher and that I am making various choices along the way that affect the game.

You can win fights by just slashing away at random, with the occasional defensive move or spell. It doesn't matter if you specialize towards melee, magic or potions, you can still win fights without any actual investment or effort, even on max difficulty. The only thing you need to worry about is not fighting enemies that are at a level much higher than your own, because a level 20 bandit is capable of slaying a
level 10 witcher, trained for battle and with decades of experience, with a single attack.
Your gear doesn't matter, because the gear you pick up off the ground is enough to carry you through the game, so no need for crafting. A éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ«éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ«éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ«?mace you pick off some dead bandit is somehow better than supposedly legendary swords you craft or obtain from quests, just because it's a higher level.
If you enjoyed the preparation aspect of previous witcher games, which is supposedly a big part of being a witcher, that aspect is gone. You can apply oils, drink potions and re-equip gear mid-fight, no preparation required.
The game has all these mechanics that could be interesting and engaging, but it isn't built with them in mind. It's built for you to blaze through it however you want to, just so you can experience the story and characters, which, to be fair, are the best part of the game. It's also got a ton of content, certain to keep you busy for a hundred of hours, if not more.
In conclusion, if you want a massive adventure with an interesting story and characters, great music and beautiful visuals, you will most likely enjoy this game. On the other hand, if you want an engaging video game, look elsewhere.",,Boomies,,

Needless to say, I have:
- Won a fistfight tournament
- Chosen a candidate to rule a nation (wont spoil!)
- Slain werewolves and many creatures
- Fished for 99999999999 amounts of sunken treasure on the isles of Skellige while enjoying the lore
- Climbed mountains and slided down tall ones, RAD STEEDZ BRO
- Romanced chicks (wont spoil also, play it for yourself also)
- Hunted for all armor diagrams
- Cleared all question marks in all 3 states, excluding the DLC ones

and so much more. the list goes on and on..
The main story? I rate it 10/10; the voice acting was superb, the music enhances the immersion and the combat system is quite unique (since it follows medival style fighting). Of course some actions led to some consequences, but i got the ending which I felt suit Geralt and Ciri.

For starters, from the first second you start the game, you are greeted with a cutscene detailing and building the world you are about to delve into. The fantasy setting fits the characters perfectly, with you playing as Geralt of Rivia, a witcher. He works well as a protagonist, because he isn't a blank slate for the player to impose themselves onto, but rather a deep and well thought-out character with internal conflicts of his own. The storytelling is immersive, allowing the player to make story-altering decisions and responses as Geralt to suit their own personality. Not only this, but the combat is fleshed out enough to allow the player to have their own playstyle. Want to craft oils and bombs to suit the enemy you are fighting? You can choose to do that, but it isn't necessary. Want to use magic to devastate the enemy? You can do that. The upgrades and glyph system allow players to form their own unique playstyle, and this makes the combat feel very rewarding.

by this i mean : All dlc missions and side missions also destroying monster nests and even contracts too with Main missions
so i really mean that i have finished The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt
I am not going to tell you how amazing the graphichs are because it's witcher 3 and we are living in 2020 . So about the great adventure of our main character Geralt Of Rivia ; this characters story actually does not begin with Witcher 3 as you can guess , it begins with Witcher Enhanced edition *IF* we only mean this GAME serie of Witcher , The Geralt himself was actually first appeared on Blood of Elves aka first book of great Witcher Book Serie , so yes this story we are going to play in this game is actually in a book so firstly i advice you read books which are telling the story of *FIRST 2 GAMES* , because personally i bought witcher and witcher 2 , but it is like impossible to play those games in 2020 , i mean it. So if you do not trust me you can go on and give it a try , but don't type me that i didn't warn you. So after you impossibly finished those 2 games or easily you choose to read the books which are telling the story of first 2 games , then now you are ready to play Witcher 3 , simple answer for a question you might be thinking at the moment ; Why read books of first 2 games but not Third one , answer is simple , gameplay , dialog selections , graphics of this game is literally awesome. I can't find the words to describe it even. So now you are ready to play Witcher 3 , first thing you gotta do is downloading 62 gbs if you bought the complete edition ( with dlcs) after that you'll be OK to play the game ( obviously ) . So here are some things you should know;
éˆ?This is an RPG game which means you will have level and your enemies will also have levels and you will upgrade Geralt Of Rivia with skill points.
éˆ?This game is fantastic which means it has Dragons , Vampires , Monsters , Elves etc. inside , if you didn't knew already ; just letting you know.
éˆ?If you only succeed with Main Missions , you will lose lots of other stories. If you are a person which hates secondary missions , don't worry the game will make you play the side missions too , i promise.
éˆ?After some time if you try to play the main story over and over you will get bored eventually so my advice is doing side missions , like really , they are not that bad and they are not repeating themselves , all of side missions has their own story even if they are really short.
éˆ?This game has treasures too , if you are interested in that . ( looking for an item for 10 minutes )
éˆ?You can go and have some *fun* with girls . Ofc if you pay it with coin.
So , my personal opinion about this game is ( i am an RPG hater )
I LOVE THIS GAME , LIKE REALLY.
i'd definitely advice you play this game and don't die before playin' it if you call yourself a gamer. Even main menu makes you enjoy , i mean it.
10 out of 10 in my own opinion.
Also this game has lots of languages so if you are not a english native nor main speaker it's literally OK , They do not have DUTCH for idfk what reason though..",,Shay,,

The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt captures the storytelling and characters from the Witcher1 and makes it better, The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt captures the combat from Witcher2 and makes it better; it takes all that and puts it into an open world of incredibleness and quality.
in The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt whether you are doing a quest
The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt is a game that it wouldn't only be just something you play and forget about, it's something you play and never forget, Geralt himself and Roach; if the game only had Roach to walk around with and talk to that would be more than enough, but the story, the lore, the characters, the dialogues, the music...the MUSIC, the side quests, the monsters contracts, the treasure hunts, the open world, the Witcher gear,  the exploration, the crafting, the alchemy, AND Gwent the list goes on and on, all in all, to create a unique, magical, charming experience that I will always ever be so grateful to whatever thing that pointed me and told me the Witcher games are a thing.
I really felt upon finishing this game that part of me is missing, a part of my soul and being is gone,

I originally played this game on PS4. I remember when I first got it, I played up until the Bloody Baron and then I lost interest. Started out a new game when the DLC was coming out and I was hearing great things. Instantly sucked a few hundred hours of my life. I thought back then this was the greatest game ever made.
I upgraded to a slightly newer PC that could actually run the game and decided to give the game another go after watching the Netflix series. For a game that is almost 5 years old, this is still the best game ever made. It has aged a little and the the combat isn't as seamless as other games that have been released since; however it is still the pinnacle of story-telling. This is high fantasy and the game/story is massive. I think people that don't like the game couldn't get into it and found the story/lore confusing. I hope the Netflix series can get people into this game and book series more; because the Witcher is an amazing story and should be considered a major rival to the LOTR-universe.

,2020-02-15,FALSE,,,,5.4,318,3,292030,315,FALSE,"Waow... I have no words.
What an absolute waste of time and money.
Okay okay, so: First off, I've tried playing The Witcher 1... didn't even get past the tutroial, so that set a bar for me right from the start. Now I've heard so many great things about The Witcher 3 through the years, but I kept my distance because of an extremely bad and unsatifying experience.
With that said, I decided to give The Witcher 3 a try... and oh boy do I regret everything about it.
First thing that messes with me is the mouse sensitivity, either you put that thing ALL the way down and make navigation in menus insufferably slow, but your camera doesn't fly round when you're in character mode... or you just have 2000% motion blur all the time, but are able to normally navigate menus.
So... Actually starting a new game! Now, as a brand new player to the series, I went all in on the tutorials, getting things explained and shown, little did I know I would have to sit and just read for  hours before the game itself even started... or well, the games tutorial started. at this point I was already considering whether this was worth it, since this lowered every expectation I already had... I mean how can I be expected to remember all this stuff with no way of getting it explained again unless I have to break the pace of the game, minimize it and google stuff?
So getting to moving around... barely, every time I move what seems no more then 10 meters, there's a new pop-up giving me another ""this is important, you do it like this, which will affect the world you play in"" generic message. Cool choices matter, I get that by now.
So (extremely) slowly and with a ton of pauses because of explanations, I FINALLY get to the combat section of the tutorial. And what do I get... never before have I had to read that much to understand a combat system. I could go on about the wall of text new players are met with.
After finnishing reading more stuff about this minor obscure detail in combat, I get to the actual thing... It's worse than Skyrims system. Extremely clunky, free-targeting-city unless you choose one specific target... which somehow always ends up in the back ranks so you might as well retarget, and suddenly, that target is in the back ranks... oh my lord. At this point I'm about ready to give up, Heavily discouraged by what feels like The Shakespere Collection in text, that has to be read and understood, and utter stupidity in combat systems. But I press on becuase there has to be some light at the end of this tunnel.
Welcome to the actual game itself. Now please have en eternaty of go-here-do-this quests with absoultly no diversity. And if you wanna defeat this foe you've never seen before... guess what, you have to break the pace of the game, stop combat and read even more about how to even damage a Noonwraith.
So at an all-time low in-game, I decide to try to get some more exp so I can be at least somewhat useful... Oh wait, let's pause the game becuase, during the tutorial we didn't make you read about skill points, brewing potions or weapon durability.
Just great...
After actually giving up on reading and just wanting to mess around, I slam my space button and just skip it, deciding to figure it out at some point when I really need it.
So finally leaving the starting... town? I suddenly encounter an enemy that's no more then TWO WHOLE LEVELS above me... and suddenly all of my attacks are reduced by 90% in damage... Are you actually for real?... Fine whatever... I'll flee and come back later... but oh wait, your health is low and you can only heal by eating food which is horrendously slow... Now please be attacked by 8  Drowners at the same time, which all stun you and kills you... and btw you didn't save so please redo all your missions.
I finally just gave up and closed the game.
So what did I learn.
- Unless you're willing to come out of the game with a PHD in Witcher stuff, don't open it up.
- Whatever you try to do, assume you have to read about it in some random book, stupid pop-up or your journal.
- Combat is insanely clunky, even if you side roll enemies still hit you and you lose 1/3 of your HP from lesser monsters... You never ever have the chance to counter attack because of sheer numbers disadvantage... And why do I have to choose between 2 different swords to even damage propperly (This should be something that comes naturally... not something a player should activly choose)
- Story is very unimmersive and flat. at least the tiny bits I got to ""experience"" (Seriously, just 2 edge-lrods in some tavern)
- There are so many systems that are so extremely confusing to new players, that they don't even bother learning them
- The leaning curve in this game just requires you to be a working at NASA.
- Unless you can connect a controller, the game is insufferable with mouse and keyboard.
- The game, AT LEAST, uses a nice color palette.
Edit: Having taken a small breather and looking at the review again, I have to say: I've completly lost any interest in gaming as a whole for the rest of the day. I really have to force myself to keep a propper tone and not curse left and right. My hands are almost shaking and I have to keep taking deep breaths and remind myself that ""It's just a game""...

The storytelling is gripping. There are some questionable events, and all the side quests (interesting as they are) don't really make sense given the sense of urgency of the main plot, but overall... wow. One day I am definitely going to read the books.
I recommend playing on the hardest difficulty: learning to become a competent witcher is not easy (it makes the start of the game very hard), but there is a rhythm to combat that will let you consistently survive, and I found it fun to hold myself to a high bar knowing that death was always a few missteps away.

i see alot of players who got an issue with bugs and complain about it but dont see the bigger picture, if people thought this game is so trash why they put in 100+ hours in the game even though there are bugs? simple answer its cos they still enjoy it. anywho i hope everyone else sees the bigger picture in a game like this, and thats the rich enjoyablility and just fun of staying awake 2 days straight hanging out alone or with one of ur siblings and eating snacks and just enjoying some time playing a game they love.

BUUUUUUUT there are a couple mods I recommend installing just for quality of life improvements.
---If you have a display driver crash (frequently Open GL) just turn off g-sync/ v-sync
1-Fast Travel From Anywhere- This mod feels essential.  However I recommend playing through the game once without it just so you can get the full immersive gameplay.
2-Custom bets in gwent games - not necessary, but I felt that if Garalt has the coin why not let him bet all his money on 1 round of gwent, F-it  why not.
3-Run/Jump in shallow water - I am not sure if this was actually added to the base game or not, but I always have it installed since its just stupid to think that a witcher cannot jump or move faster than a slow walk while in shallow water

For a game made in 2015 it still holds up really well graphically and gameplay-wise.
The main issue regarding some open world games is that some parts of it feel dead. This is not the case with Witcher 3 as every community, even the forests and seas have their own form of life and culture.
You have choice in this game as well, and whilst you can go about killing everyone, you would also feel the same satisfaction from not killing and befriending someone that could have been your enemy.
The RPG element is also properly fleshed out to make your character strong but not so strong that it makes the game overly easy. It it worth noting that it does have a learning curve but once it is figured out, you can build the main character to suit your play-style.
The amount of attention to detail in this game feels like they made the game and let it marinate by having playtesters.
Some games you get tired of the UI and the game mechanics, but in Witcher 3, you can interact in so many different ways, it takes really long before it gets repetitive.
Lets talk about the music. This game's soundtrack is definitely one of the best ever. I have even began listening to the music on YouTube when trying to do other work-related tasks.
Different locations have soundtracks that relate to the culture of the people there.
The voice acting. What can I say but it is spot on. There is also humor blended throughout the voice acting. For example, when you run through crowds of NPCs and bump into them they make funny remarks or weird sounds.
There were some bugs in the game however. I have encountered a few with Roach running down hill but nothing was game-breaking or affecting my actual gameplay. These bugs were hilarious and added to the humor characteristic of the game to me.
Overall, I recommend trying out this game and even though you might be overloaded with the gameplay mechanics at first, just give it 2 hours. I am looking forward to what CD Projekt Red is doing for their future games.",,SystemRichie,,

,2020-02-15,FALSE,,,,126.7,325,9,292030,31,TRUE,"What does it take, in my humble opinion, to be the best game? Is it the fun factor? Is it the moment to moment gameplay, happening while weéˆ¥æª™e playing and nothing else? Is it how interesting the concept is? Or is it the story, the world and the people of our games? Or is it something else?
Maybe itéˆ¥æªš everything. Maybe itéˆ¥æªš how the game makes us feel or how it impacts us on a personal level and on the gaming industry as a whole. I could have chosen a lot of games that fit these criteria such as God of War or Skyrim, two games which I have enjoyed and will continue to enjoy endlessly. But in the end, Iéˆ¥æª‡ have to choose The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.
Now I didnéˆ¥æª› pick The Witcher 3 cos itéˆ¥æªš anywhere near perfect, any one as soon as they boot up the game can realise there is something deeply wrong with the control system, itéˆ¥æªš clunky, stiff and downright awkward indoors, moving through small houses, alleyways and doors is a pain the éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ«éˆ¾? Moving in combat can feel inelegant due to soft lock-on. Take Roach out on some bumpy terrain or up a rocky mountain and youéˆ¥æª’l end up with a migraine. The controls are unruly and unyielding, and youéˆ¥æª’l basically hit every object you can.
The Wild Hunt and Nilfgaard are also really underdeveloped. We never really see Nilfgaards diversity in culture, which is mentioned in the books. In The Witcher 3 it seems they are only there as invaders for narrative purposes, you will have to go far out of your way to learn anything about them of substance and still then itéˆ¥æªš not that much, the same goes for The Wild Hunt. Both groups are missing a degree of characterisation youéˆ¥æª‡ expect, especially since the rest of the game is so rich. Considering The Witcher 3 is not a game of black and white, The Wild Hunt is depicted as a generic evil. Ask yourself, whoéˆ¥æªš your favourite villain in The Witcher 3? I highly doubt youéˆ¥æª‡ say Eredin.
Onto combat. Is it great? I wouldnéˆ¥æª› say itéˆ¥æªš bad, but itéˆ¥æªš definitely not the best part of the game. It can be clunky, and it does not flow very well on the whole. The alchemy system is not as influential and can be seen as an afterthought especially on easier difficulties, and the game overall is not that hard. Even on Deathmarch I barely felt I was in danger even against the toughest of foes.
Now you might be thinking, éˆ¥æ·—ow is this his favourite game when heéˆ¥æªš literally ripped into it for 3 paragraphs?éˆ?Well itéˆ¥æªš simple really, every game has its flaws, even the best of games. Some games take their flaws to the grave, eaten alive by the disproportion of the frequency, but The Witcher 3 does not. It is a game that has a stunningly amount of care put into making the story and the world and the immersion feel unforgettable, its dynamic and thought provoking, full of choices and densely packed with twist, turns and nods to prior games. At every corner something interesting seems to happen, A Tower of Mice, Where the Wolf and Cat play, No Place Like Home, Paperchase and so many more interesting quests, not presented in some generic way though, but complicated, cloudy and very different, especially the cast.
Imagine reading the Bloody Baron synopsis on a sheet of paper: Alcoholic man, hurts family and seeks forgiveness for what heéˆ¥æªš done. Not the most original idea is it? Iéˆ¥æª“ sure every one of us has seen the same scenario in some form, whether it be tv series, book or another game, looking to portray the same emotions and character, but does it turn out any other way than you expect? Does it ever get as twisted and knotty and morbid as in The Witcher 3? A simple troupe turned multi-hour spiderweb of intricate detail, full of immediate player choice in the matter, with no one ending up the same in the end, whatever road they take. It hits on every emotional peak and valley and itéˆ¥æªš only one questline in the game. How about this headline? Woman plays love song in a tavern. Or Ciri? Itéˆ¥æªš the classic Chosen One on the run troupe.
The framework of The Witcher 3 is quite basic, but itéˆ¥æªš intention and presentation are extraordinary. Content has an amazing amount of characterisation and intricacy, taking you into these beautiful lands full of strange faces and interesting things to see, these characters have real stories, many of which the player can partake in, often influence outcomes as well. How can you not care, when so much work has been put in the game? Even the monsters, gross as they may be, are not black and white. Werewolves with feelings, Vampires, are they friends or foes? Mutants we might pity and more, even a ghost in a tree has a developed story. If you find something in The Witcher 3, chances are that it is well fleshed out and exciting, unlike most other titles. It can be incredibly engrossing to those willing to dive off into the deep end, into The Witcher 3éˆ¥æªš tale, as you learn so much about why you are playing and what it means to the people in it.
Itéˆ¥æªš got many flaws, as I mentioned earlier, but they donéˆ¥æª› detract from the immersion. It is a beautiful game, an enchanting adventure and a complicated masterpiece, with some flaws which you can easily ignore, when all is said and done.",,King Kurtus,,

+ Fascinating world and lore. Once again thanks to the source material as well as CDPR's intuition.

Graphics - Notably the tree and foliage models.
Highly original and exceptional soundtrack. Notably Kaer Morhen, Whispers of Oxenfurt, The Mandragora, and much more.

+ Fantastic modding scene. (Though there are limitations).
+ Runs smoothly.
- MAJOR ISSUE: Geralt selectively uses Axii (mind influencer) and his (superhuman) witcher senses for plot convenience. This issue is apart of the underlying defect within the entire Witcher universe where magic and worldbuilding do not have distinct identities/defined limitations. This can mostly be attributed to Andrzej Sapkowski's disregard for his own universe. Unlike that of J.R.R. Tolkein or even George R. R. Martin, Sapkowski is known to view the world as a mere means to an end. (That end being the story and characters.)
- Occasional poor writing.
Arnvald from the quest 'King's Gambit' is written terribly.
... and more.
- Ubiquitous and hilarious 'Ludonarrative Dissonance'.
- Inappropriate/awkward use of music. CDPR needs to learn how to insert their music with subtlety and finesse.
- The occasional but nevertheless jarring ultra low-quality animation.
- Combat fails to be engaging and skills are not balanced - Enemy upscaling is the only way to keep the game challenging, even on Death March difficulty.
- Dismembering humans causes the limb/body part that was cut off to instantly morph into limb/body part of a default model.
- Lacks Polish, mostly in terms of movement, especially on Horses.
- Extremely low-resolution texture work on various objects as well as highly cartoonish blood textures.
- Unrealistic terraforming in the base game. (Slightly improved in Blood and Wine.)
- Downgrades.

Not a lot can be said about this game that hasn't been said already, but here we are:
*POTENTIAL SPOILER AHEAD*
Having played the first two games, I was keen to get into the story of the third one. Friends had told me about how epic this game was, and I was hesitant to really believe it until my first play-through. The main story is about the same length as the first two games combined (roughly 80 hrs) if you complete all of the side missions. Then there are the DLCs, which are fantastic expansions of the original story and should definitely be played if you enjoy the main story.
I ran the game on the lowest settings at the time I write this, but even with the worst options possible, It still looked fantastic. New features such as the fast travel and the ability to ride a horse were vast improvements on the first two games.
The attention to detail within the world is excellent. The choices you make can alter things such as the NPC dialogue, or character's actions after a specific choice in a quest is made. I bought all three games + DLC in a sale for æ‹?0 and I can honestly say it is one of the best buys you will ever make for a game franchise. Easily re-playable thanks to the multiple outcome possibilities available. You will either spend 1 hour on this game and not enjoy it, or spend hundreds of hours on it and never stop discussing it.

Recently, I decided to give it another try. This time, I wanted just wanted to explore and experience the world. I talked to interesting characters, helped them with interesting problems, read the lore and bestiary, and accidentally found my passion for witcher alchemy. A little patience on the main story, and I was blown away: The world is dark, sure, but it is rich. Each side quest, each each, each self-made quest for alchemical reagents is beautiful, natural storytelling. The fights are challenging, but fair. The stories are emotional and complex. The cities feel massive and alive. It doesn't feel like everyone is just there for your benefit -- they couldn't care less about you, except maybe to spit and sneer at the mutant freak.

There are two things, which carry this game to its high praise. Its graphics and narrative. The writing, the camera work and the aesthetic manage to pull you into an amazing experience. This game will be worth your time, if you're willing to forgive the gameplay, bugs and horrible balancing. I have bought this game twice, once as a hardcopy in the store (gog-copy) and once with all the DLC's on Steam. I have gotten every achievement on both platforms, played every diffuculty, every dialogue option and every sidequest, contract and even point of interest. I played through it 6 times with a total of around 300 hours. So believe me, when I say, the difficulty settings are horrible, weak mobs are too strong and the bosses comparably weak. You'll have far more trouble against 3 drowners than against the main boss of the game and everyone in between. The AI is also terrible, which will become clear after the second fistfight you engage in and the houses, where you're forced to fight in, are not designed to be fought in. The surrounding rarely impacts the fight negatively, but since there are two instances, where you're obligated to fight, you'll be even more frustrated. After having visited all the points of interest, I can say, with full convidence, that there are not enough big monsters to fight, so I advise you to, at some point, enable the console if you're feeling up for a fight. Also, the environment has a broken collision system. You're horse will get stuck on small slaps, branches or randomely stop. You'll sometime die, when jumping off a ledge, even though you'd survived it 10 minutes ago from a higher ground. There are some objects even missing collision and you'll pass right through them (most of them on the coasts of Ard Skellig). The hit-reg system is random too, sometimes enemies will hit you at the very start of their animation, other times they should hit you, but do not. The range is also buggy and deviates from the mobs animation. Your companions can killsteal, meaning, they can kill a mob and you won't get the xp for killing it. Which is frustrating, when your long awaited level up is postponed (nit-picky, but still worth mentioning). But still, after all of those points, it's still the best game I have ever played. As I said, the writing carries this game, as well as the graphics. I knew every monster, every main character and every location, after having played it twice. I even listened to some soundtracks every now and then. I got so much joy out of this game, that I can only say, you have to buy it, you have to play it. That's the best journey I have ever been through. 10/10",7.66E+16,Dephite,,

Not only is the game around 50 hours long (took me around 45 to see the credits roll, but I was ignoring a few side quests), it also has a couple very long and enjoyable DLCs that offered 30 or so hours of additional gameplay.

,2020-02-13,FALSE,,,,121.9,343,3,292030,239,TRUE,"This game for a while was sitting in my library but I finally got around to playing it. The story and the atmosphere design over all is just purely 10/10 material. You get a lot for your money here even the DLCs are over 10-15hours long and longer if you do all the side quests; this is especially true for blood and wine. I still haven't finished blood and wine but I see an overwhelming amount of value for my money only 6 hours in. The DLCs are definitely worth a purchase it just adds to the game.
Lets get into some negatives though:
1: This game only has one major shortcoming in my opinion which isn't surprising to most who have played it; the combat could use some work. Due to the combat being a bit weak I can see a lot of people not playing through the first 10-15hours. However later on with signs and bombs and oils you can make it more interesting. Also a lot of modifications available to help adjust the combat if you feel necessary on the nexusmods. Some complain it being to easy or hard at first the truth of that is it starts hard then once you pass the first 5-10levels and get some gear it becomes easy on any difficulty. This is enough talking about the combat over all its definitely the weakest link of the game but doesn't ruin it in my opinion.
2: Another fault of the game I can think of is the awkward placement of higher level monsters and enemies throughout the game. At first starting off you might be urged to explore the beautiful world in this game. However once you do you might notice at first you run into monsters and enemies 10+ levels higher than you and end up killing you in a single blow. This is a major issue in my opinion in an adventure game and isn't forgivable but this does get better if you stay on track with the quest log and is avoidable.
But enough about the faults as I said above in the header - the game has a lot of beautiful 10/10 material for you to enjoy. The story telling is amazing and the environment is definitely worth exploring and going back to, I encourage you to explore once you have the gear for it or over level the zone there are a lot of hidden quests as well.
In summary or TL;DR - Witcher 3 is a content packed game with high quality storytelling and beautiful environment to explore with a lot of replay value. It has a shortcoming in combat design and zone balancing but is easily overcome by just following the path and paying attention to quests levels. Anyone looking for a very good RPG adventure this game is definitely worth every bit of the money + the DLC. It gets a very solid 9/10 for me with a very solid recommendation - you will definitely get 100+ hours of enjoyment out of this one.",,Meki,,

Everything from the main story to the side content to the overall tone itself just fell flat.  When it wasn't boring, it was utterly predictable.  The open world gameplay was a terribly scaled, nightmare slog that I quickly lost interest in.  Most every enemy I fought, most every quest I accepted, and most every recipe, schematic, or piece of equipment I found was wildly above my level.  This game actively, derisively tries to kick your teeth in if you engage with its core loop.  I have never played a game - never mind a AAA, year defining game - that so completely and incomprehensibly botched both the scaling of its content and its core rewards system.
The problem is so pronounced that it discourages you from delving into literally a third of its skill tree.  I found zero use for alchemy because every bomb recipe I ever found was for the orbital thermonuclear variant where I couldn't even make the Fisher-Price Baby's First Bomb version.  Same goes for the potions and weapon oils.  Crafting was similarly useless.  I never found a weapon or armor recipe under level 20.  And I was being rewarded these things at level 1...
I was ready to give up shortly after getting to Velen and encountering level <SKULL SKULL THREAT LEVEL ALPHA DANGER> enemies in every direction.  The combat is so one-dimensional and tedious that it's possible to kill the bandit that's 35 levels higher than you, but its absurdly tedious.  Difficulty is simulated by giving enemies entirely too much health, endless parry bars, and attacks that take a third of your health.  Definitely makes you feel like the witcher badass the game keeps crowing about...
I only continued playing, after downloading a mod to fix the absurd scaling, because I found the overall grimdark tone of the game to be so ineptly presented, that it was actively comical.  Most of the quest content beats you over the head continuously with the theme that Witcherworld is filled exclusively with lying, selfish, degenerate éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ«éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ«éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ«éˆ¾î™?  You will do no good in Witcherworld.  You will stir the garbage because there is only garbage and you are garbage.  I'd say 90% of the game's content could be distilled down to a general script:
1. Person A hires you to kill a monster that killed their best friend ever, person B
2. In the monster's secret clubhouse, you find person B, still clinging to life
3. They reveal that Person A betrayed them and is secretly a war criminal who éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ«éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ«éˆ?29 women
4. You return and kill Person A
5. In their diary, you find the entry: ""The ballad of how Person B is a war criminal who éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ«éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ«éˆ?29 more women than I ever éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ«éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ«éˆ?",,,,
6. Person B escapes - oh you dumb merciful donkey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is funny for a while, but when it gets old, the game just crashes.  I made it through the main quest for Velen and Novigrad before traveling to Skellige.  When I opened the map and saw an entire new continent filled with question marks and yellow notice boards and even more of a soulless main story, I just wanted to quit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So I quit.  And I have no interest in how the story resolves.  I don't care about any of the mystery around the wild hunt or the weirdo masked elf guy or Ciri or any of it.

I had always thought that as fantasy games go, Zelda would be the only one to really catch my eye.
The Witcher 3 changed this completely. This game not only has hundreds of hours of playable content, it's exciting, rewarding as you progress through, the expansion pass adds a new city to explore and delve into and every step of the entire game is fantastic. Character progression is great, upgrading Geralts kit, everything about it made me want to play more. I can't say more good things about this game.

The story is phenomenal, the characters are lovable the mechanics feel really solid, and its just all around beautiful (if you've got a rig that can handle it.)
This is game design at it's finest!!  However, I have a few problems with the main questline.  At times the repetitive nature can be rather tiresome at times.  But overall, its worth playing through fully because it's really exciting.  The side/witcher quests really make up for the repetitive-ness of it. There's so much story to be discovered and so many monsters to fight.
My other gripe is, for me, not having played any of the other witcher games, the ability upgrade system felt rather overburdensome.  There's so many options for upgrades that it's hard to choose what to go with.  But once you get to a certain level, you should have enough various upgrades that you can swap certain ones in and our depending on your situation.
I cannot put into words how much fun this game is.  I feel as though it should still be listed as a $60 game even five years after release.  At the same time, you shouldn't feel like you need to get it immediately, its worth to wait for a sale, especially if it's bundled with the dlc(s).  Which are insanely good and I'll post a review on each one in the future.

It's a great game, but you don't need me to tell you that - many other reviewers have given it the thumbs-up.  It's beautiful, immersive, gripping, dramatic, funny, moving.  The expansions are good too, I recommend the whole kit and kaboodle.
It has its issues - swimming/underwater is frequently annoying, but perhaps that works to make risky diving actually seem like a feat to pull off.  Targeting is frequently a bit dodgy (played with a controller).  Inventory management, even with the stash, is frequently tedious, and the stash was just exceedingly slow to access with any modest amount of stuff in there.  The game is huge; so much stuff to do.  If you just play to churn through everything to finish everything I suspect it would largely feel like a chore, but switching attitude to just enjoying the various adventures and sidetracks along the way makes it quite a different experience.  Quite a few of the secondary quests are meaty enough to be savoured on their own merits without worrying about how it gets you to ""the end"".  Not all of them - there's a bunch of nothing quests and stories with potential that perhaps just aren't realized very well.  But there's so much good stuff here that I find it impossible to be negative about this experience.

(self to note, the game has a good story, thats not the bad part)
The introduction of the game was good. The option for if you want the basics of the combat and magic casts or not was a good thing.
I got hooked into the game, but the more I progressed, the less I wanted to play it.
I travled into the town with my companion, then some cutscenes then I got my first objective.
I began exploring the town, meet some guards that didnt liked I drawed my sword. I liked that thing, it adds some immersion I gotta say. But then I accidently stole an item in front of  a npc in his hero. He didnt react, then I thought, why didnt I get accussed of stealing. Then I stole another item, another, another and so on. No consequenses there.
Also NEVER scare a npc or a kid. They make your ears bleed with same scream nearly on every npc. For the womans scream as an example, it really sounds like the same voice actor on all of the womans who are not part of the story. Even with the kids, when they yell. It sounds like this. ARRRH iggghhhh, ARRRRRGHHHH,ARRRH iggghhhh, ARRRRRGHHHH. Rinse and repeat with no delay between the sounds of the screams.
Also a noteable mention is selecting objects like fire candles or even a bag to loot. It is a nightmare to select objects with the camera. In first person  wouldnt had been a problem, but it can also be done good in third person.
I had to pick an note up, but there were people standing near the table which means that you can talk with them or rather they tell you something. But by all means, the way you speak with them is the SAME freaking key you use to interact with. Ofcouse it would be the same, but I had to get the perfect angle on the camera. It took some time, but it did not end there, I had issues with that exact problem in many other places.
The combat was also a bit meh
Also not to mention micro stuttering when moving the mouse. Other posts I read that it goes back to 2015 where the game was released, where the issue also present. Feels like a console game, because zero issues on a controller on 2 different machines.
Heres some links that confirms that issue and is still present
Game is marked as a Open world, RPG, Story Rich game and masterpiece according to Steam in the tags.
The game after my own opinion dosent have the RPG(RolePlayingGame) elements as stealing something with no consequenses. Game is also marked as atmospheric, well.. not with these screaming npcs with only 3 sounds on them.
Marked as a masterpiece. It has issues, that is game breaking for me. When using the mouse and keyboard, is a no go, controller is needed for a smooth experience, selecting objects is a nightmare.
All this I mentioned so far. I have not yet found any reviews writing about this so far. Game is a true masterpiece. Well it has some issues that is present

Results of your very own choices are not for a few different dialogues. In fact your choices create a new atmosphere of relationships between many various characters.
The story is absolutely phenomenal and it is also where the game shines at most. Sure, the environment is good, but there is no chance it's perfect. Bugs are unfortunately unavoidable. With animation errors and bugs I don't see the world worth to be immediately fully explored. Repetitive undiscovered tasks are swarmed in almost every location imaginable, therefore it is not necessary to explore the world before taking quests. Take your quest first and explore the world for the undiscovered tasks then, that way you can actually have fun and complete your quests at the same time.
At first I didn't like it. To me it felt like every open world game that is doomed with its repetitive combat system and missions. However as soon as I start investing more hours into the game I got immediately hooked on by its adventurous story. I wanted to know what happens next, I wanted to know how my ""relationship"" with other characters evolves. Game does that well, hence why I couldn't stop playing the game for a whole week.
For the combat system to be fun you need to study your enemies. Investigate their weaknesses, then apply specific oils to your sword, use various bombs or simply abuse attack & dodge technique (but using that technique you will get nothing but a damage sponge match).
Try to overcome the game's first experience as I know it is not the strongest perk of the game. After some hours you will most likely be addicted to the game and will not make a single step out of your room.",,Surreal Baby,,

,2020-02-12,FALSE,,,,54.5,357,3,292030,262,TRUE,"I finally got a chance to play The Witcher 3, and I must say it lives up to the hype.  This game does a fantastic job at pulling you into the world and giving you reasons to keep exploring it. The game does a great job of taking you on an epic adventure throughout the main story.  The lore, the characters, and towns all flesh out the journey in way that few other games have.
As someone who has not played through the Witcher 1 nor the Witcher 2, I feel like the game's story works well on it's own. You play as Geralt of Rivia, a witcher. A witcher is basically a group of humans that undergo mutations through potions and most see them as mutants. They were created for combat and they take out monsters throughout the land for money, usually. They are a dying breed because they stopped creating more because the whole process of creating them was completely unethical.
The story starts with Geralt as he is looking for Yennifer, a sorceress he has known for a long time. It develops quickly from there and takes you down a winding path filled with all sorts of humans, dwarfs, elves, and monsters. Without spoiling anything, I absolutely loved the ending to this game - there are multiple endings as well. There is a specific relationship Geralt builds throughout the game and I think it really makes the ending (that I got) great.
I would be remiss, if I didn't bring up Gwent. Gwent is the in universe card game and at first I didn't want to get into it. But I decided to do a quest related to it and next thing you know, I spent a handful of hours playing everyone that would play me to build a good deck. To give the very basics: You get 10 cards, you play cards on the board for points. You need the most points in 2 out of the 3 rounds to win. Simple concept, but even with a good deck there are no guarantees.
The combat in the game is more than that of a simple hack and slash. If you try to play this like Dynasty Warriors you will die quickly to basic monsters early on. You need to be blocking, parrying and/or dodging enemies to survive. You also have some handy tools that make fights much easier. You can use some basic magic, potions that heal or boost damage, and oils that can boost damage. Preparing for the specific enemies at hand can make life much easier, but I did find that I could make it through battles without preparation on the normal difficulty.
I did not get a chance to play the DLC fully yet, but the parts I have played have been really good so far. Also you can get some really good Gwent cards with it, so don't miss out on those.
Overall, everyone who said this game was great back when it came out in 2015 were right. I am glad I finally got a chance to play through it and consider it to be one of the best games I have played to date. If this type of game interests you at all, I encourage you to take some time and play The Witcher 3.",,H2O Hero,,

Itéˆ¥æªš clear from playing it how much love CDPR poured into this project. W3 boasts an absolutely overwhelming amount of content that maintains a refreshingly high average level of quality.
One aspect of W3 I particularly enjoyed was how many morally grey decisions there were to make. The world in this series is not black and white. Sometimes being a hero makes things worse in the end. Sometimes a monster deserves death even if it meant no harm. Sometimes you have to decide what the lesser evil is. Decisions in W3 constantly kept me thinking and rationalizing my actions.
With an incredibly lovable cast of characters, an intriguing storyline that your decisions affect, an amazing soundtrack, stunning visuals, fun and complex gameplay, I never tired of The Witcher 3 throughout its entire multi-hundred hour tenure. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy, as I think almost anyone can find something to love in the rich world provided.
I should also say that the expansions for Witcher 3 feel like just that: expansions. The Witcher 3 by itself is absolutely a complete game and they are not essential. They are, however, undeniably worth it. Hearts of Stone is a smaller expansion with a story that I would say is the best quest line in the game. Blood and Wine is massive and easily adds 40+ hours to the game at least. The Game of the Year edition is worth the small amount of extra money you pay.
Note that potential new players should recognize that this is the 3rd game in a series that is also preceded by several books. While Witcher 3 can be played standalone and understood just fine, I do recommend familiarizing yourself with the world by reading some summaries of, at least, Witcher 1 and 2 beforehand so you wonéˆ¥æª› feel so lost immediately upon starting the game. Oftentimes Geralt and his companions reminisce on past events that have happened that a completely new player wouldnéˆ¥æª› understand.
PS: if you buy it, be careful about playing Gwent. You might get sucked into playing a deceptively addicting card minigame for 20 hours in which case Witcher 3 takes a hard change and becomes a PokèŒ…mon game in which you are maddeningly dedicated to finding every card you can to boost your deck and win every tournament in the land.

If a side quest is better than many many main quests in other games then you know the developers are definetly one, if not the best out there if it comes to this. I didnt play any previous Witcher games, and neither did i read any of the books about the universe but i think the world building is absolutely amazing, the characters are often not at all one sided and you yourself have to choose many diffcult decisions.
The first time i played this game (about 2 years ago) i didnt enjoy it, simply because i wasnt able to step into this world and take it all in, however i recently decided to give it another try and i didnt regret it. with 33.2 hours in my current playthrough i know there is a lot more to come and i know that i will have fun with the game till the last second.
To round it up: If some bugs and glitches here and there dont annoy you too much and if you like RPG games then why dont you already have this game ? The developers are one of the few that are trustworthy and i am hyped for cyberpunk 2077 but until its released i will make sure to finish this masterpiece.

That being said, and in fairness, I'll list the pros and cons of this game.
CONS
- The combat, levelling, and alchemy systems feel a bit clunky and overwhelming when you first begin the game, and as a result can make getting into it a bit difficult.
- The mapping system is a bit wonky at times and can glitch out and not lead you in the best direction.
- The horse is probably the most overtly terrible part about this game. Numerous animation glitches that trigger fairly easily, an unintuitive summoning system that can result in the horse spawning in inaccessible locations, being unable to get to you do to the horse AI being unable to navigate tight terrain on its own, and a rather janky feeling riding system that is a bit too sensitive (some of those issues might be with my controller in fairness)
- Animations can at times look a bit janky, especially facial animations and I haven encountered a few rendering/cutting issues in cutscenes, but overall it's not too bad.
PROS
- The game is just stunning. This is easily one of the prettiest games I have ever played.
- Combat and systems. Once you understand the combat, crafting, and alchemy systems of the game they feel veery satisfying.
- The story of this game is very well written and the choices you make in game feel impactful, not only for the ending but for the world around you.
- The map is enormous and has loads of things on the side for you to explore.
- The Witcher Contracts are some of the most fun quests in the game. Really puts you in the shoes of the title of witcher as opposed to just telling you you hunt monsters for coin and never actually letting you do so.
All in all I highly recommend this game. It's huge, it's amazing, I've put 71 hours into it and I'm not even close to done with it.",,The Hatman,,

Back 4-5 years ago, my brother told me that this new game called ""The Witcher 3"" was coming out, me being the stupid idiot I am, I just said ""oh cool"" and did nothing more with the information I had required.
Until the Netflix Witcher series came out.
From that moment, I knew what I must do. I bought the game during the Winter sales, for éˆ?4.99 and it's the best éˆ?4.99 I've spent in my life.
This game captures it all, the wonder and awe of exploring the highest peaks and the deepest oceans, the fear of being chased by something you know can cut you down with ease, the happiness of conquering said beast, the enchantment of participating in ""The Witcher Trade"" and hunting down the nearest monster or bandit camp, but most importantly this game captures the essence of family and the never ending, impossibly irreplaceable love that binds people together.
I came into this game with the highest of expectations, and not once was I dissapointed, time and time again this game excelled and excelled, setting the bar higher and higher for the next quest or fight, and every time it met that bar, and smashed it to smitherines.

At points, I found bugs or slight texture problems, but nothing critical or nothing game-breaking. The only time I needed to force restart the game, my character of Geralt simply froze in combat, and could not and would not move, and upon dying, the game continued on as if I was alive.
This game honestly has it all, and if you, reader, are considering buying this game and giving it a whirl, I can only suggest it with the highest recommendation I can possibly give.

For me it was at the end of the Novigrad part of main storyline, but what mattered even more is that I didn't get there in the fastest way possible.
You really must give a chance to all aspects of the game. Some might seem obsolete at first, like oils, potions and alchemy in general, but within time you realise that in certain situations those can actually help you a lot.
As opposed to Skyrim, loot doesn't have a stationary armor/damage rating, but instead goes along with your level. So 90% of the stuff you find will be either better than what you currently have, or just a small bit worse (unless it's a really really common enemy drop such as bandits, but in chests and while exploring the situation is guaranteed). This leads to the fact that you actually feel glad that you found new loot, while in Skyrim you were technically able to get near top tier loot very early if you knew the proper locations, which made the rest of the looting in game often unneccessary or boring.
One thing I've seen people mention with this comparison is the fact that they feel like they're watching a movie rather than being the character. This is debatable and again, I'd say it comes mostly from the fact that you didn't go deep enough into the story. Skyrim gives you the chances to be on top of almost every faction, guild, brotherhood and all such things in the game. It makes you feel almightly. This game, despite being a fantasy, keeps you down on earth. You know your limits, but you also know how versatile of a character you can be, being bound to multiple character throughout the whole Continent.
Storyline might be a bit confusing at first, but with time you really get a hang of it.
But I do plan on doing that when I get my fill in this game, which is still far far away.
One thing I recommend is to instantly turn on
. Being overleveled occurs rather early in the game, at around level 15 or so, so I recommend that you turn this on as it just makes sure that enemies don't die in a single hit late game so that you get used to it. Not turning it on and wanting to do so late game will most likely result in you reverting the setting back. And trust me, being overleveled is much much more boring than facing a death-threatening enemy with starter gear.",,avaq,,

This game feels more alive than probably 99% of any other game ive played. The movement of the trees in the wind. The dynamic weather. The chit chat going on in cities. The game for being 5 years old has aged magnificently so far. It has more to do than  probably anything else ive ever played. I dont want to spoil anything for anybody. Just know if you did watch the series and are curious if this is worth a try I would say absolutely yes. If you give this game a chance you will thank yourself.

So it's a great, immersive world. Absolutely stunning terrain and weather effects and a vast land to poke around. However I wish I was _doing something so, so different_ or more interesting in the actual world. The combat is pretty dull and repetitive besides a few ""set piece"" monster fights I've seen so far. Controls are a bit janky and every room feels cramped while every cave seems way, way too dark. I didn't really get pulled into the (admittedly standard/boring seeming) story, but I'm not much for ""listen to characters talk in third person view while you make 1 of 2 barely different choices"". The open world was so...by the book too. I was hoping they'd change the formula but it was the same tired map icon collecting and repeated events and  concepts. Also merchants with limited gold and being showered with constant, meaningless loot is really tedious (especially when you spend 40% of your time holding Witcher Senses down to see every last minutiae of junk).
I never came home from work thrilled and anxious to play this game, it was a bit of a chore and I had to reason with myself why it would be ""worth it"" to grind through the creeping sense of boredom. The game clearly wasn't a good fit for me but seems to be a smash success for literally hundreds of thousands of people, so who knows.
Overall a sad let down. I was hoping to get utterly hooked and play hours and hours, but alas. Maybe I'll try again and just start with one of the DLCs.",,Deep in Cups,,

Hundreds of hours worth of content, incredible soundtrack, and a fantastic story. This is one of precious few games in recent memory that has true expansions. Blood and Wine is a must have, it's basically a whole separate game on top of the main story.
This game will throw you right in so if you're not at all familiar with the Witcher, the Netflix show is an excellent introduction to the characters and world. In fact, that's how I got into the game in the first place. I can safely say this is my new favorite game and franchise. I've even started reading the books.

,2020-02-09,FALSE,,,,99.8,404,1,292030,39,TRUE,"TL;DR; The hype around the game is justified. It's a great game all around.
There is probably not much to be said about TW3 that hasn't already been said at this point, but I wanted to add that it's still, and probably will be for a long time, worth playing even if you've no idea about its lore or the previous games.
The story is probably the main selling point for the game, it's very fleshed out and the characters well written. The world also helps bring it to life with myriads of side quests and stories that don't feel repetitive or templated. The gameplay feels fluid and satisfying, especially in higher difficulty levels. The graphics are beautiful, and even when they become dated, you'll still occasionally find yourself just admiring the view from a high place.
Overall I would recommend this game to anyone wanting an enjoyable RPG experience, without grinding or tactic-heavy combat, just to sit back and have fun in a vast and adventure-filled world.",,georgesdoe,,

,2020-02-08,FALSE,,,,155.7,422,1,292030,223,TRUE,"A great game, with rich story, interesting side quests, and amazing setting.
The world is full of war, plots, and the terrible consequences, with each region shows strikingly different culture, depending on how close they are to the front line.
The graphic is still beautiful in 2019, with wide array of setting available, although i had some trouble with alt tabbing in and out, and frequently glitch the fullscreen.
Gameplay wise its tricky.
The core mechanic, the witcher sense, is quite annoying to use and can be somewhat disorienting and tiring to use. I strongly recomend turning the minimap hud to show the witcher sense just so you wont get stuck while looking for tracks. The whole mechanic is iffy and could be better implemented. Even without the fish eye effect, you need to hold a button to maintain witcher sense, sometimes it slows you to walking pace, the tracks often very hard to see, and it lacks colorblind options. all that complaint combined with how almost all quest and sidequest strongly rely on this gimmick makes this long game somewhat a chore, not to mention the combat.
The combat and skill tree is really shallow. The skill tree looks like it allows player to choose their way to play, but by the end of the day everyone should invest a lot on the blade skills, with every other skill tree optional at best. You can choose to play alchemy, throw bombs, drink potions, oil your blades, and fight for 5 minutes, or just go for blade and swing 4 times to kill a miniboss.
The combat is interesting, but it lacks progression and is very repetitive throughout the game. You gain almost all your signs, oils, potions and bombs early on, with few unlocks as you play, then slowly the oils feels less important, signs is strictly optional, and the same dodge and swing from start to finish.
All in all, the gameplay feels lacking is merely because its accompanied with stellar story, which sets my expectation a bit too high.
The gameplay serves its purpose, as for the rest, I have nothing but praises.",,X1è„?,,

I recently started my second playthrough after having completed the first one when the game came out 5 years ago and I'm finding that I still remember most of it as it just made such a strong impact on me. I've read the books, played all 3 games and now watched the Netflix show and goddamn do I love this world. This game is incredible and I'm really looking forward to playing the DLC which I never got around to. If you haven't played it yet, you're honestly depriving yourself of an experience, not just a game. This is one of those games that defines what gaming is for a lot of people--it's the kind you'll look back on fondly and remember as one of the experiences that made you really love gaming. Do yourself a favor and play it.
The one criticism I see people bring up that has any merit is that they think it's boring. While, I don't feel that way at all since I'm a huge fan of the world and lore, I can see how people might be put off by the extreme amount of conversations and cut scenes. I find this to enhance the game, but some will find it to be the opposite for them.

In case you're interested in a slightly more info:
Only thing I would advice against is going into the game completely blind. If you are thinking of getting into the game due to the hype, you might end up feeling the game is over hyped. Have a look on Youtube or the wiki and see if the story, lore and characters interest you. The beginning of the game can feel a bit boring so try to mix it up with doing side quests and exploring the map.
Combat also seems to be a deal breaker for some people. It's up to the player to make it interesting. You can choose to just spam right click and dodge here and there until the enemies are eventually defeated or mix up your combat with signs, bombs, bows and so on. The Bestiary helps a lot in harder difficulties.

Overall, game performance is solid, with no hiccups or freezes, and you can enjoyably play it on your mid-range PC. I was getting 40-50 FPS in the base game on High with some options like NVIDIA HairWorks set to Low or Off. ""Blood and Wine"" DLC is more demanding though.
I'd like to address a couple of things. One of them being that you can't set those white navigation points that are shown on the mini-map to your liking. Once you use your green marker, those dots are not changing. They can only point to the quest. Sometimes it's a little confusing and frustrating. Nothing major though.
Also, when you're in the water, it may happen that Geralt won't dive for whatever reason. The only solution I found is to save the game, reload, and then it works again. It doesn't happen often mind you.
There are some other minor inconveniences like Roach getting lost in the way when you call her, or the fact that you can't see the number of owned ingredients while shopping unless you pin specific formula in the Alchemy tab, but it's very rarely interrupting your game.

Quests aren't boring , with enemy upscaling they become even more challenging. Would reccomend buying game of the year edition when it's on discount. Was suggested the same by a friend and this was the best choice I ever made. Worth every penny. I haven't even started DLC quests and I'm already 110 hours in , this game is BIG. There are a lot of guarded treasures and secret locations to discover and there is always something to do , something to loot. You may experience some bugs , tho they aren't in any way ruining your experience. The great thing about the game is that you don't really have to play previous games in order to catch up to the story.

The unbeatable, unshameable, can-do-nothing-wrong Witcher 3. You know what it's about in general. You know what many people think about it. But I'm not one of those people. Read on if you want to read a differing opinion. Avoid reading if you're one of the many who pray every night to a shrine of various Witcher 3 paraphernalia.
It's a fine game. I give the story an A++. I give the sound and voice acting an A++. I give the visuals a B+. I give the presentation (UI and UI manipulation) a B. I give the optimization an A+. I give the level of polish a C-. And I give the controls an F. Yes, an F. An F, as in the lowest grade. An F for failure.
I can't express just how much I despise getting around in this game. Geralt moves around like an angry 400-pound guy being propelled by hurricane-force winds. That's how it feels. When you push forward on the analog stick, he starts off at a walk, but very soon after, he breaks into an awkward, janky, closed-fist quick jog, and that awkward movement is to be your primary method of getting around.
Thankfully, the developers made him switch automatically to a walk whenever you enter houses, et al, but the moment you emerge into the outdoors again, you're at the mercy of that janky run. Turning corners while running? Forget it. Geralt only makes ultra wide turns, like a lumbering 18-wheeler turning off the highway without having applied the breaks when they should've been applied. My God, guys.
I know. I know what you're thinking. The game has so much to offer, why not focus on that? Why make your review about this? I'll tell you why: Because the crappy controls prevent me from enjoying all the content to the fullest. Look, I'm not asking for Miyazaki-quality animation here. All I need is a smooth walk-to-run transition that amounts to perhaps three different walking animations of increasing speed BEFORE the run begins. That's nothing to say of the run itself desperately lacking any indication that Geralt is an athlete of any kind. Ugh.
I've gone back and forth, from Xbox One Elite Controller, to Steam Controller, to keyboard and mouse, and I've decided to settle on k/m because the animations are just garbage, so I may as well just jank-run everywhere and keep the walk function bound on my MMO mouse for easy access in case I need to slow his big, dumb self down to turn a corner or stop in front of an NPC to talk to them without body-checking them first.
And the thing is, I know CDPR can do better. They have the talent, don't they? If they didn't then, they should have it now, what with the gobs of money they've made since the game's release.
And why not revisit the game? Why end support of it? Is this not your pride and joy? Bugs are everywhere! I was just in a tavern where some guys were watching an empty stage, hooting and hollering and making lewd noises, only to discover that the ""Strumpet"" they were pretending to watch was doing her little strumpet dance by the tavern door where I came in. Seriously?
Should I even mention the random townsfolk sitting in mid-air in various locations? It's no wonder they're weeping... I'd weep too if I was anchored to the air no matter what I did. And as a cherry on top, every time you die in battle, there's a delay, and then Geralt's corpse does this gravity-defying hop into the air before being thrown across the terrain, as though he were suddenly the victim of a drive-by poltergeist.
Guys, other games have been blasted to pieces in reviews for less bugs than The Witcher 3 has. They've been laughed at, spit at, made the butt of every joke meme you can think of. Mass Effect Andromeda never gave me so many problems. INB4 ""I agreed with you until you supported MEA."" Yeah? Oh well. I'll say it. I'll risk being slammed by gamer mob mentality: Mass Effect Andromeda was and is in a better state than The Witcher 3.
My God, it's just so unpolished. It's so unpolished that I actually fear for the release state of Cyberpunk 2077, so I won't be purchasing that one on release day. I'll wait to watch some gameplay first, and for a patch or two to drop.
Do I recommend the game, ultimately? Yes. Why, after all that? After my annoyances? Because the story is fantastic, and it's long. Anything that well-conceived and long can be weathered in spite of the lack of polish. I can do it. Doesn't mean I'll enjoy the ride to the utmost degree.
P.S. Yes, I only have 4 hours here. But I have over 30 on GOG, which is where you should have bought the game if you wanted to support CDPR to the best of your ability.

,2020-02-06,FALSE,,,,8.4,448,1,292030,257,TRUE,"This game is awesome, in every sense of the word. Once you get on the back of your horse and travel across the land you'll more than often gasp at the beauty of your surroundings. So many details...  You move past a field of wheat and what do you know? It actually moves in the wind, that's a level of detail which is easy to miss but once you spot it it also really adds up.
The story itself is easy to get into, even if you haven't played any earlier titles and are completely new to the franchise.
Finally the controls... there are many to learn and to get familiar with but fortunately the tutorial can help you get up to speed quickly enough. And there's always the in-game glossary which you can use to read up on things such as the tutorial.
So far, so good. It's obvious that a lot of attention has been put to detail and it's noticeable. The atmosphere of the game is  also plain out astonishing.
But....  there are so many nice details to this game that the things which don't go right, or which don't make much sense, easily stand out. And that's a shame.
For example...  In the beginning you come across an inn keeper who's very grateful that you saved their kin and so they tell you: ""
"". Great, but if you then ask them what they got to offer you you'll enter a shopping dialog and suddenly have to pay for bread and other supplies. Whatever happened to my free meal?
You're a Witcher; a warrior who can wield magic and who knows how to stand up against the occult; monsters, demons, etc. To this end you also carry 2 swords: a regular one and one made out of silver, which is more effective against those monsters. However... because of all this Witchers aren't exactly loved by the people, most will distrust you because of all the unnatural things you can do. And you can do a lot... Fighting, magic, brewing potions.
Yet out of everything you can do, you can't manage to repair your own gear. Once your sword starts giving out, which unfortunately seems to happen rather quickly, then you'll need a craftsman to fix it. Really? You can improve on your weapons but you lack the skills to repair them yourselves? Given the dislike and distrust amongst the people regarding the Witchers this made absolutely no sense to me. Surely such an order would try their best not having to rely too much on those who generally mistrust you?
And finally the tutorial explains a lot but not everything... During your first real quest you'll get a crossbow and it's suggested to use it in order to prevent your prey from escaping.  ... if only the game would have also told you how to actually use it, that'd help. But it doesn't. Even the tutorial only mentions your swords and how to exchange between them, yet it ignores the crossbow completely. Eventually I discovered a mention of the crossbow in the spell selection screen, which also made 0 sense to me. But after I selected it I still couldn't fire; the regular button you'd use to cast spells kept casting those. Even though I had selected something completely different....
Eventually I found out, by reading the comment section of a wiki; this mentioned the middle mouse key, but it's still a bit sloppy to say the least.
The atmosphere of this game is awesome and the game itself does a lot of things right. If you're into RPG's which are set in a medieval fantasy environment then prepare to get sucked right into it. The story feels fresh, is easy to follow and plain out intriguing.
There will be a few issues which may not make sense or which may come across as annoying at first, but honestly... those are also easy to ignore. I definitely recommend this game.",,ShelLuser,,

I have pick the plants on the map so much so that I have to turn off the notifiers so I don't spend the next 3 hours picking blowballs and false parley until crash head first into my keyboard. The quests require a bit of soul searching-- put coins in the purse or let the poor guy keeps his daughter's measley 23 crowns dowrey. There is humour galore, a lot of of dry. There is crafting, skill trees that aren't too obnoxious, and plenty of times when if you don't brew the right potion and put the right oil on your blade it's painfully obvious. I find that pretty good for a game. It makes you stick to the lore and not just overpower things. I forget how to counterattack most days, but at least I get the parries in.

Well over 100 hours of gameplay here, if you are a completionist i would say at least double that . We live in a day in age where developers/publishers deliver so little and demand so much money, but, CDPR, is above that, they deliver, and can always reserve some of my paycheck!

Even a small side game (Gwent) within the game. The main story is decent too. Optional playing styles because of the use of Signs versus a one dimensional melee style. Graphics are good.  It's only a one player, which is fine since I am not into PvP.  For being a scripted game, it's very good.
Cons: My biggest complaint would be movement.  Specifically, it's a little too overboard with being realistic. I know it's tough to literally stop immediately after running, but Geralt sometimes goes a bit too far and it more of an issue when sliding down half of a mountain when it would be more realistic to grab onto something to stop. A bigger issue is dealing with Roach. One picky horse.  Either it's a glitch or just a clumsy design.  If you aren't on a perfectly smooth path, the horse is a pain to move at times. Reaction... a bit slow.
The only other thing I can think of is... too many deaths from falling from relatively small heights. I don't expect Geralt to be Assassin's Creed because a jump or slip from 30-50 should typically end in death, but 10-15 foot drop and you lose all your health?  It would be more realistic to break a leg then use a ""mend"" potion, which doesn't exist in the game. Meaning, maybe it should. Jump down 10-20 feet... break your leg... Geralt says ""Dammit""... drink a Mend Potion... then says ""that's better"" and keeps going.",7.66E+16,Brandamoor,,

If you answered YES to any of those questions, this is the game for You.
You play as Geralt, a mutant with cat eyes and hair as pale as your malnourished flesh, that hasnéˆ¥æª› seen sun in a week, will be after finishing this game.
Story begins as Geralt embarks on a journey to find love of his life, but not before traveling through cities, farms and slums, taking on every monster contract in known world. Fist fighting everyone, forcing all humans and nonhumans to a round of Gwent.
The game offers well-crafted stories with choices that you make and which shape your journey. You can become a monster, who incites fear in everything living or not so... Or become Saint Gregory himself, a paragon of virtue who picks daisies, and helps to paint trollséˆ?fence.
The World éˆ?itéˆ¥æªš massive, as massive as the hole in your heart when you finish the game. Hundreds of locations, more NPCs to talk to than real life, each with their stories and quests to offeréˆ¥î›‡nd some even more than that, if you catch my meaning.
Gorgeous graphics and animations, superb voice acting. Your jaw will drop, more times than wind has howled. Each time you ride through city or see a mountain range immersion takes a hold of you, and after some time youéˆ¥æª’l never want to go outside again. Even the most mundane thing you do, will feel as if orchestra is following your every step, with three ladies yodeling about your every move.
Fighting will become a second nature to you, using swords, potions and signs to your advantage, reading books about monsters. Learning how to slay beasts for money and not getting your éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ«éˆ¾?killed in process is an experience only few games offer.
Witcher 3 aged like a fine wine. Considering games that have come out in past couple of years, this game will take a hold of you. You will be satiated - real life will seem bleak and boring. While being at school or work, only thing you will be thinking about is éˆ?how can I complete that contract and what armor should I wear for my next fight.

The open world is amazingly, lovingly...almost mind-bogglingly detailed.  Every corner of every map has -something-.  The empty marsh with a forgotten secret treasure.  The unexpectedly beautiful vista after climbing a rise, standing out in such a stark contrast to the warn-torn countryside you've traveled through to get there.  Abandoned cabins which tell a story all of their own.  This is all the EXTRAS.  Places you do not have to visit. It's all just ...there, waiting to be discovered.
The quest design is brilliant.  Given the complexity of trying to make a story in an open world where you could find things completely in the wrong order, the designers are nearly flawless in the execution.
Most of all, controlling Geralt feels ...natural.  Much, much better than Witcher 2.  I am NOT a power gamer and yet I can easily crossbow an oncoming foe, cast a quick sign for protection and draw my blade to attack.  This is also the first game where riding a horse and piloting a small skiff works so well I don't mind doing it, even when sometimes I could quick travel.  There are some places that are just fun to gallop your horse through.  Or speed your boat through the waters.
The scope of this game is just breathtaking.   The story is dark and gritty, so much so that you wonder if the world isn't so completely messed up that you should just let the bad guys win.  But then there are those moments - and they are rare, true, but moments where you have a chance, if you want, to make a bit of hope.  Restore a village.  Save a merchant.  Bring a family back together.   You can't change the world - Kings will be éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ«éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ«éˆ?and wars will be wars - but you can do your part to make it better, one quest at a time.  This is the part that seems -most- analogous to our everyday real lives:  we can't stop politicians from being éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ«éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ«éˆ?or wars and violence from happening, but we can do our part to make the world a little better place, one day at a time.",,Kaji,,

(only reason it's not top 3 is because multiplayer games are more my cup of tea)
The story and world is fleshed out, raw, mature, kinky and gruesome with little to no room for improvement, it's good enough that you end up reading all the flavor text, but you're not forced to closely read up on any of it to understand what's going on, you could probably just open most readable's once and the game will note down any important points you need later, bringing it up when you need it.
Combat is hard and unforgiving if you don't stock up on healing items, but a few skills can make healing items way to effective, I mean ""food items last 20 min"" who thought that sounded balanced.
Was hoping taking on certain types of monsters would require more preparation but at the same time I'm glad you're not totally boned if you're in combat with a ghost and didn't bring it's weakness with you.
Music is spot on luxury to the ears, though I did get enough of the combat theme after a while.
Leveling and gear is well thought out and can accommodate a wide range of playstyles, light armor for high  amounts of time spent combat rolling, heavy armor if you can't be asked to dodge even to save your life and medium for people with decent dodging skills but still want to live if they mess up a dodge.

People are SO RUDE and I'm loving it, I think some of the NPC's would just fall apart if they don't call someone or something the son of a woman of easy virtues every other sentence.

The small fraction of the reviews are negative and most of them relates to this issue. If your main source of entertainment comes from combat then it might be hard to ""get into"" in your first hours. After a few hours the story grips you, and at that point, the game transforms into a high quality TV Show with constant cliffhangers which keeps you ""hooked up"" until the end.

Any 'grind' is pretty much unnoticeable, since there's something interesting for your character to do, no matter your level. Mod support is excellent, and the mod community is still active. The controls? Eh, at first, I hated the way 'spells' were cast and 'items' were used. However, now, I see that the game developer's goal was to force players to strategically predict encounters with enemies, and plan things out, rather than relying on pure reflexes and spamming buttons to win. The expansions are also badass. Great deal, overall - I spent $15 bucks on the whole collection on a steam sale, which I consider to be my best game purchase, yet.

The combat is nice although it is quite easy. On normal and easy difficulty, I managed to survive battles without using potions, decoctions, and oils. I restarted the game without finishing the story and decided to play it in the hardest difficulty from Level 1. It made the game more fun for me. One thing I have issues though is movement for both Geralt and the horse (especially the horse). I was expecting a Red Dead Redemption kind of horse but what I got was a cockroach. The horse just can't keep on the road. It prefers bumping into a tree or heading into a cliff which of course it subsequently tries to avoid falling from. This happens a lot when I gallop.

It's immersive, it set a new standard to open world character-driven narrative games, and most importantly, it's a nice big ""éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ«éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ« you"" to EA because, just as everyone with a brain knows, single player games are NOT dead. This game is a golden answer to that.
It is not without flaws, of course, but the flaws I found and experienced as I played through this game for nearly 400 hours is equivalent to sand between my toes while I enjoy my time at the beach éˆ?it's annoying to have them but it doesn't put a damper to everything else I experienced. This game is time and money well spent, truly revolutionary in a lot of aspects.
Some might say that God of War may be that game and I wouldn't blame them for it. It's just that, to me, the time I spent going in blind (I've yet to read the books and I went into this game without having played the previous ones) is definitely one of if not the most memorable moments of my life as someone who is a simple fan of video games.

His army of elves

Broke down my lute
And they kicked in my teeth
While the devil's horns
Minced our tender meat

Toss a coin to your Witcher

Fight the mighty horde

Far back on the shelf
High up on the mountain
From whence it came
He wiped out your pest
Got kicked in his chest
He's a friend of humanity
So give him the rest
That's my epic tale

Defeated the villain

The graphics are fantastic, the voice acting is fantastic, the story is fantastic, and aimed at a mature audience. There is SO much content to discover and the DLC's add dozens of hours more.

Broke down my lute
And they kicked in my teeth
While the devil's horns
Minced our tender meat

Toss a coin to your Witcher

Toss a coin to your Witcher
Oh, valley of plenty
At the edge of the world
Fight the mighty horde
That bashes and breaks you
And bring you the morn, oh

Far back on the shelf
High up on the mountain
From whence it came
He wiped out your pest
Got kicked in his chest
He's a friend of humanity

The thing about the Witcher 3 which sets is apart from the rest is a level of craftsmanship in the world from the main quests, side quest, general world building and random encounters. For example, I was attach by some random bandits on horseback near Velen and I killed them with ease. Went ahead and looted their camp only to find a letter from one of the bandits to their wife which mentioned bringing something home for the young'un from their ""da"". It got me thinking and whilst a small addition to the game, it makes you think about how these bandits are people beyond simple video-game fodder.
Other endearing parts of the game are the easter eggs and callbacks to previous games (for those who played Witcher 1/2 like myself).

The sheer number of side quests the base game itself offers is insane, and of actually good quality, length, and story development, unlike most fetch quests games of this genre may usually suffer from. The main story itself is good too, though you'll likely find yourself ignoring the questline as exclamation points or question marks constantly pop up as you even make your way to the next destination. Before you know it, you've spent 2 hours on finishing side quests and contracts, and playing gwent alone.
Another thing that makes the story stand out is the fact that choices actually feel like they have impact in this game. Missing or ignoring certain side quests, or choosing bad options during the game can drastically affect the outcome of the game in terms of its lore (if you care about that). Also, you may miss out on certain gwent cards which is a massive rip. As such, you live with your decisions, something games for some reason find difficult to make work.
The overall environment looks beautiful and cutscenes, especially *certain* ones, are very well animated, making the game feel more immersive as a whole. The OST, characters, and ""herbs schmerbs, but how 'bout some gwent"" are great.

The equipment is pointless. Your swords will be 10 levels past their prime for hours of gameplay. Run three witch bounties and you'll replace your original and two of the bounty sword rewards in 30 minutes.
The story doesn't care about how you play. There is no time or performance penalty. Racing an NPC? You're fine to stand around for 30 minutes then run through normally and win.

,2020-02-02,FALSE,,,,117.9,526,0,292030,25,TRUE,"This game is definitely one of the best games I have ever played. The amount of care, detail, and attention put into everything is absurd. Every sidequest, even the most mundane ones, have charm and meaning to them. Every structure you find has a story behind it. All the enemies have unique and interesting designs and mechanics. The world is absolutely beautiful and is a wonderfully realistic and immersive setting. Novigrad is easily my favorite video game city of all time.
But I do not understand the unending praise this game gets.
Don't get me wrong. This game is absolutely fantastic. But this game is not a masterpiece. You hear this term just about everywhere, but it's a flawed gem. No game is perfect. Every game has problems. And the Witcher 3 has some annoying, hard to ignore problems.
The combat, for a game of this scale, is pretty great. It's clunky at first but you get a hang of it after a while. It's complete éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ«éˆ¾?when fighting multiple enemies though. Those Wild Hunt Hounds are absolute hell to fight in packs. Hitboxes can be occasionally janky and enemy telegraphs aren't clear a lot of the time. The biggest problem with the combat, however, is that after a certain point it becomes way too easy. I was playing on the second highest difficulty and I was spam clicking just about every enemy without much trouble. The only things that challenged me were the three big bosses you face towards the end of the game. I really liked the feeling in the opening of the game where you had to prepare before a big fight. Brew a bunch of potions, buy food, temper your weapons, etc... and you do that for like 4 more levels and you don't have to anymore. Really wish that feeling was consistent throughout the game.
I find that the story loses some of its stride after the climax. It becomes a generic save the world plot - more about stopping the big bad than about developing characters or finding new interesting ones. There's really only three characters other than Geralt that see development during the final act. It's a real step down from when you were travelling across the Northern Realms, finding old and new friends, discovering their motivations, and watching them have actual character development. Just kinda stagnated towards the end. Also the ending is meh. Really could've used more explanation and there was some stuff that just... made no sense. The ending wasn't offensive, it was just 'whelming'.
I. Hate. The. Minimap. It's bad. Since nearly every single quest has a location objective where you have to travel somewhere through complex road systems (getting Roach through a forest or swamp is a pain in the éˆ¾ãƒ¢æ«éˆ¾?so taking the roads are just easier), you have to heavily rely on the minimap's little dotted line telling you where to go. This is bad. You end up looking at the minimap 50% of the time. It's more difficult to immerse yourself in this beautiful world when you're not looking at it half the time. I turned off the minimap which greatly improved my experience, but I still had to open the map a lot to know where I'm going. It was pretty satisfying when in Novigrad I memorized the streets so I only had to glance at the map once or twice though.
I won't be going in depth about the pros of the game because I'm sure every review here will do that for you. I do still highly recommend this game. I'd say its a must-play.
One warning though: If you're looking to play a game that's about exploration first, story second, this ain't it. You'll still enjoy it but it won't be what you expect. The world is meant to be more of a realistic and immersive setting to the main story and the multitudes of sidequests there are. It's a different take on the world that I don't really mind. Breath of the Wild is still my favorite open world adventure game to date though.
P.S. kinda salty that this game stole all the rewards from Bloodborne in 2015 ngl",,Keeko,,

,2020-02-01,FALSE,,,,108,531,0,292030,72,TRUE,"At the time of this review, just a few months separate us from the fifth anniversary of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. The game has been called out by many to be the game of the decade, and I've decided to do a short no-spoilers retrospection on why is that the case. All of this coming from a player that hasn't even started his first NG+. PS.: I intended to keep this review short, but as I couldn't, I will include a TL;DR section below, targeted specifically to people that have not yet decided on whether to buy the game or not.
As you play as Geralt of Rivia, an already fleshed out character with its own personality and acquaintances right from the start, I would not dare call this game an RPG, but it is far simpler than saying that it is a ""story driven action game with lots of decisions to make, some of which may have bigger or lesser impacts on the main story. Oh and you have lots of character progression, with various skill trees you can choose abilities from as well as lots of bombs, oils, potions, weapons and armor you can craft with materials you gather along your journey"".
This RPG aspects of the game might drive out players that don't enjoy the genre, but it is very likely that they fall in love with any other aspect of the game. Aside from that, the game has four difficulties in total, and only the highest one REALLY demand you to make full use of these aspects to have an advantage; the other two allow you to have the upper hand whether you utilize the games' mechanics at full or not.
The combat is pretty basic, but it is very exciting and has a fluidity that makes up fully for its lack of depth. Combine that with any battle music track that the game rocks, and you will have an epic fight even against a simple drowner.
The music, as already foreseen, is simply amazing. I genuinely did not have any moment where I thought ""hey this track is somewhat lackluster"". Hell, there was this one time that I ended up humming 'Merchants of Novigrad' all day (for those who do not know, Novigrad is an important city of the game, and what I mentioned is an ambient music track played on said city). As I do not have any intricate thoughts on the matter, I beckon it will suffice to say that The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt stars one of the best soundtracks that I have ever listened to on a video game. Who woulda thunk.
Even though you play the role of an already built character with relationships of his own, the games' story and general narrative are incredibly enjoyable, not to mention that you still have a whole lot of decisions that build on Geralts' personality and make him a different character overall. Geralt is a really good main character, and he is one of the main reasons I keep playing the game. He's cool and interesting, his insights on various situations and his conversations with almost every character made me really want to flesh out his character and get to know his personality and relationships. The game has a large amount of secondary quests and contracts, and almost every change of track on your adventures rewards you something.
And we yet have to disclose graphics. The game was for me an INFINITELY immersing experience from the beginning. While you travel through the world you will encounter a lot, believe me, A LOT of incredibly beautiful places, landscapes and towns. I really recommend playing on High graphic settings, even at the expense of some frames if you don't have a high-end PC. Halfway through the game I just ramped up my settings just for the sake of even more beautiful landscapes, and at least for me, 50+ FPS is already an amazingly cinematic experience. Just the view from the balcony at Kaer Morhen on the very first scene of the game told me this was going to be a beautiful experience.
And it was just that. From joy to grief, from sadness to excitement, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt made me feel a lot of different things. I really recommend that you play the game without spoiling yourself anything. The emotional spikes hit harder that way, and it really helps that you involve yourself on the narrative and on the characters' problems.
The only things I found to be issues to me were horse traveling, minor problems with the 'enemy upscaling' feature (on a certain djinn fight specifically), the underdeveloped character that was our main antagonist, and that the urgency of the main quest is not reflected on Geralts' journey (this, from my point of view, was inevitable, given the type of game the developers wanted to build, and the main quests' theme on the other side of the table). Two of those issues I cannot refer to due to my 'no-spoiler' disclosure, but they don't affect how the game feels AT ALL. And don't misinterpret me, the horse traveling isn't bad at all, in fact it is really good and it achieves its purpose. The only thing that bothered me were those moments where the horse randomly stopped while galloping, which lead me to just canter, and keep enjoying the scenery. A good thing overall, I guess.
TL;DR: TW3 is a must-try game. It goes really cheap for what it is on sales, and if it doesn't really hurt your pocket, then you must ABSOLUTELY try it. If it doesn't catch you when finishing the first act, then you can reconsider. If it is the RPG aspects that scare you, then believe me that they are not a big deal, specially on easier difficulties. They might even draw you into them as you play the game. TW3 rocks an amazingly good soundtrack, beautiful landscapes, and fluid combat. In this review I couldn't stress enough everything that I felt while playing the game, nor I was able to comment on every well done aspect the game has.
And that 'sums up' my experience. Please forgive my abuse of the same adjectives on multiple parts of the review, and my redacting skills. I didn't really intend to make it this long. If you have any recommendations, things to add or points to discuss, please feel free to leave a comment!",,Ragrez,,

Combat is quite simple, but never feels boring. Getting new potions, oils and decoctions feels rewarding. The skill trees have their flaws (some early game perks are broken, some late game perks are terrible), but overall make it feel worthwhile to try different builds for the fun of it (even on the hardest difficulty, nothing is brutally challenging without mods).

But combat itself, along with all the various animations, is simply fluid and beautiful, especially on harder difficulties it is challenging all the way through the game. And the graphics is stunning for now several-years-old game.
All in all, I must repeat what I had been told before I purchased the game on numerous occasions - a TRUE must-have for all fans of RPG genre and much recommended even to those who only play such games on special occasions.

,2020-02-01,FALSE,,,,163,539,7,292030,188,TRUE,"People call this the best RPG/Open world game ever created, I think that's overrating this game. Personally I prefer the first 2 games in the series since they followed a non-linear ""act"" based format instead of Open World.
It's already been said a million times but the graphics, writing, sound, music are great. So I won't go deep into that.
The locations and visuals are a downgrade from Witcher 2. I mean go back to Flotsam Forest in W2 and then back into W3's ""Trees and a random copy paste village in between open world""
It does suffer a bit from Ubisoft syndrome where there's a lot of copy and paste activities sprinkled around the map but they can be easily ignored if you want and it's best to focus on side quests and Witcher contracts. The weakest quest types are usually treasure/scavenger hunts.
Crafting/Alchemy is still under developed and bloated. On the bright side, the game is incredibly long to support them this time, since Witcher 2 was 20-30 hours long. The movement, animations, horse controls etc are really average compared to most third person games.  The Combat is a slightly improved Witcher 2, never has and never will be great.
Trust me for someone who has played the first and the second games for over a decade, the series has always been carried by it's storyline, characters and writing. The Witcher has always been a gloried walking simulator and I'm okay with that. Yennifer, Bloody Baron, The Crones and Ciri are the highlights here.
The games first part which takes place in Velen is some of the best stuff I've seen in the series. However, once you reach Novigrad you'll experience what I found to be the weakest part of the game. The problem is the whole Dandelion part being dragged on probably even breaking the record for way too many fetch quests. Considering the game has another island to explore after that, you could get burned out especially if you're unfamiliar with the first 2 games. Also the whole ""roleplaying"" and choice making doesn't seem to effect you drastically in this game beyond choosing how big of a prick you want Geralt to be.
The weakest part of the entire game though is Eredin and everything to do with the Wild Hunt. Three freaking games for it to play out this way? Why did he have to take off his mask? Yes Letho and Geralt talk about the Wild Hunt being Aen Elle but I would have preferred if they still maintained some kind of mystic around him. I remember being excited back in 2007 and not being familiar with the books thinking that the Wild Hunt was going to be a rendition of the myth of the dead army that roams across the sky.
Game is incredibly long, being an open world game, the 80% of your playtime will be you getting from point A to Point B. I enjoyed it but actually did see myself getting burned out by the time I finished the main story, Heart Of Stone and it's sidequests to move on to Blood and Wine which takes place in Toussaint.
My recommendation is to play Blood and Wine after taking a break from finishing Main game and HOS. Heart Of Stone is the second highlight of the game, first being the Baron/Crones questline. Another highlight is Gwent being far better than dice as a minigame this time around.
Verdict: While I think the third game is probably the weakest, and the series never managed to get combat/crafting right it's a great end to one of my favourite game trilogies.",,Unconquered,,

The game itself have a lot of content in it, there's a lot of sidequest, a lot of contract to deal with, and a lot of interesting character in this game.
