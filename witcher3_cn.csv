"this game is absolutely huge and rich with storythis open world game has a lot to offer in the form of a variety of queststhere are four types of quests main quests secondary quests witcher contracts and treasure huntsthe world is riddled with these quests and many are something that you simply stumble upon in your travels from one place to to next
i would highly recommend taking the time to break from the main story to take on these additional side questsif you get too far into the game some quests become unavailable or you will get very little experience for them if you are too over leveled for a quest you only getexpthere are so many quests to do that it can be a little overwhelming but there is a ton of online resources you can use to help you ensure that you do the lower level quests when they were intended to be done
the game runs very smoothly level wise if you follow closely to the suggested levels the game providesthe quests vary as far as the level of storylore that is offeredhaving completed the main game and both expansions on the ps i can safely say that this game has a great storyive puthours into the game at this point and can easily say that this is one of the best games i have ever played
there is a huge range of difficulty options for this game it can be insane dark souls level hard or story driven easy modeso if you want a game with a challenge this can be what youre looking for but if you would prefer to explore the story this can also be what you are looking forhighly recommended for those who like open world rpg story driven gamesthis game does have an element of rpg to ityou can play geralt different ways and immerse yourself into the story very easily"

"im not into fantasy games at allbig time mass effect fan and mostly lean towards scifithis game is phenomenal so far and im sure itll only get better as things progress
it took metries to get into it but it was worth the effortgreat game so far"
"its good"
"the witcher 
what a game i went into this game completely blind off the back of a mates recommendation late mind you but that changed nothing the game is fun and fluid the combat is fun and quirky and allows for many play styles the story of this game is incredible and its totally possible to lose yourself for hours in just one sitting of this game
of course there are downsides the game does show its age in graphics and with flaws like junk pickups and items that dont really do anything which is annoying at most
this game has a lot to offer and i highly recommend it"
"pretty fun open world the story is really interesting and the game does a great job of having some side missions continue to engage on short stories from the novels big fan"
"good"
"i wrote a review that was better than most of the essays that ive written but i accidentally deleted it so ill just summarize the spark notes
i bought it on gog when it came out played through most of the story got busy got busy and then a couple years later got the itch to play again and couldnt figure out my gog account so i bought it here with all the dlc
weapon combatnot as deep as some other games but enough to keep you grinding as you progress the story this is how i played the game
spell combathas different uses depending on the situation and can sometimes be extremely useful also pretty deep especially after the mutagen updatedlc quest line
storyimmersive choices matter and will have an impact on a large amount of things which characters do you like romance etc
enemiesget somewhat repetitive until you get to the dlc which brings a lot of new stuff
dlcamazing some of the best dlc put into a game hearts of stone adds a new questline which is great wine and blood adds a whole new area that couldve been its own game in its entirety
in conclusion should you buy this game yes it goes on sale pretty often and you can get the game and its dlc for a fraction of its original price its no wonder that this game still has people buying ityears later one of my favorite games"

theres just two things i want to note first if youre on your first play through enjoy it and take your time nothing will ever compare i wish i could forget i ever played it just to experience it again second pay attention to the characters faces theres so many subtle animations that are blinkandyoullmissthem and ive yet to play any game that can convey real emotional through character models like this game does

"great game a must play for fans of swordsorcery rpgs the character development is fun and progressive great story modern singleplayer rpgs struggle to find the right balance between story and combat and this game does a great job it still feels a tad linear i didnt truly feel like geralts life was in my hands but the story was good enough that i can forgive the lack of choices in dialogs and story direction
for me the worst part was the gwent card game i really wish game developers would quit with the obsession of putting card collecting into video games i like card games i own a bunch in rl but i dont play video games to collect virtual cards its frankly just silly"

or perhaps i did like it hard to tell right now
stories great characters are cool but it does have a few issues
the game engine is a little cranky it works ok mostly but npcs do glitchcontrolsmenus can be buggy forcing you to save and exit to regain functions
its also not the kinda game you can dive into for a half hour here or therejust beware of that

"ofcox this is a good game what u mean by review lel"
"i had no expectations i actually dropped this game for a while after a few hours of play before some quality of life updates to the hud now its my favorite game of all time ive spent close to a hundred hours on just one playthrough before dlc and if thats not a testament to the depth and pure amount of content in this game i dont know what is the enemy variety is enough to get you hooked at first then the well conceived quests keep the entertainment value going and the game feeling fresh choose a harder difficulty than you expect as a careful and calculated approach to combat is an experience that sets it apart from other open world rpgs but only if you choose to make it a challenge get the gourmet perk first
the biggest con in the game is the romance dialogue geralt is a ing badass until hes confronted by the notion of anything romantic or sexual to which he turns into ayear old boy or what ayear old boy imagines a badass dude who has sex sounds like dont worry geralts dialogue outside of this context is either quality or passable the overarching story is high quality and is interwoven into the game itself the writing and the games structure worked together to convince me the player that i wanted to find ciri and thats something i pay attention to and not many games can accomplish i didnt give aabout greybeards or alduin in skyrim i just wanted cash loot my only motivation in an rpg cant be the end of the world i dont give aabout that because its a video game and im the good guy the worlds not going to end in this game not only do you get cash loot but a reason to find cash loot i would say that the wild hunt arent exactly the most menacing bad guys from a plot or gameplay perspective and as theyre the main antagonists and drivers of the plot i have to ding it half a point but what video game actually does manage a tight compelling plot from beginning to end while achieving all of that other stuff i mentioned
 outrageously good may update review after dlc content and new game plus"

"i always hear people praising this game and how amazing it is and when i got the chance to try it i thought why not especially with the show that just come out
although i didnt finish the game i think the story is very interesting and i will definitley watch someone playing the game to find out more about the story
but gameplay wiseits freaking tedious
 the fighting mechanics are just bland theres nothing special about them
 i understand that this is a game where you need to finish side quests to be able to continue the main one as you need to be a certain level to continue but my god if this game doesnt make it a boring chore not only are the side quests extremely boring they also barely gives u any xp and killing enemies also barely gives you xp which i guess makes sense as geralt is a witcher that dealt with monsters all the time or maybe i just dont really understand how to level up in this game but its still frustrating as im not a fan of the grind at all
 voice acting is not as good as people say it is maybe comparing it to other games that are similar it definitley does but its still not good geralt usually have very awkward lines every now and then and even though i didnt think the voice suited the character it did grow on methe other characters are either too awkward or too dramatic ciri is an exception she was really good
 do you have to show every girl naked and flirting in order to attract males i dont really mind the nudity but the cringy fantasizing about the girls body and features is just cringy and unnecessary im a girl and i feel like im playing a game that portrays a mans fantasy and theres nothing wrong with that i just cant relate and thats an issue when youre trying to grab someones attention its really unnecessary
this game is really overrated i tried my best to get into it but i just cant its too boring"

pros
excellent graphics
excellent acting
fun fighting
cons
thirdperson
way too many buttonscommands to remember
boring storyand lots of it
i like games that one button will do one thing all the time in this game one button will do a variety of things depending on where its being used add this to the fact that youre in thirdperson and the game gets awfully confusing very quickly when i play a game i want to spend more time enjoying it than i spend learning how to play it this is not one of those games because of this i have to give it a thumbs down i must just not be like the majority of the gaming community"

thank you cdpr"
"great rpg game"
"this game is still amazing the story side quests exploration monsters and overall immersion are so good combat is not my favorite a bit frustating some times but the game is so much worth it for everything else
replayedof it and all dlc for the second time after the tv show got me thinking about it loved every hour
but i strongly suggest you go after some quality of life mods like showing every quest on map naming all the potions in your inventory and even no fall damage a couple of tweaks make the game even more enjoyable"

"roach fked my love interest in this game
 ign skyrim but with slavs"
"gameplay 
pros
 the monster hunting is fantastic and some of the monster contracts are incredibly memorable especially on higher difficulties when you start to interface with all of the games systems together
 the open world also works really well its not as populated as an ubisoft open world but theres still so much to do and the atmosphere of each location is incredibly memorable
 you want to explore and you are pretty well rewarded for exploring with some great gear
cons
 some of the movement controls can get frustrating during exploration its not the most responsive but you get used to it
 the soft lockon system can also sometimes be a little weird when fighting multiple andor flying enemies
 the rpg elements can very quickly turn certain builds and abilities in monstrous op builds that let you mow through everything the game throws at you it also turns certain abilities and builds obsolete especially at the highest of difficulties unfortunately some of those are very interesting abilities and systems
gameplay w modsbut thats the beauty of pc mods i would strongly recommend installing the fcr mod for small tweaks that stay close to the vanilla game ghost or enhanced edition will provide some pretty serious overhauls there are some other smaller ones such as the preparation mod that throwback to the previous witcher games or the friendly hudmeditation mods that really make gameplay a lot more fluid if you have never played the game try it on vanilla but if its not vibing with you then try mods before shelving it
story 
pros
 characters are absolutely amazing they drive the story forward and keep you invested in seeing every story through
 side quests everybody talks about the side quests and for good reason theyre amazing and flesh out the world of the witcher in ways that you would be remiss to overlook in your playthroughs
cons
 unfortunately not every story thread and character arc many side charactersand i say that because its hard to say some of the characters who arent main characters are side characters because theyre fleshed out so well get the closure you may want i suppose that emulates the real world but its unsatisfying regardless
 the crux of the main story find ciri is so incredibly convoluted that in my opinion it detracts from the story it is supposed to engender a sense of urgency in you but as an open world game you simply can ignore it with no consequence
 but it gives you time for the excellent sidequests so
conclusion 
 im still playing through the witcherand just now going through and getting the achievements and stats on steam after playing through once using the drmfree launcher since i didnt use the steam client none of my stats were tracked but its a good excuse to keep playing i think i probably have another goodhours on top of my current steam playthrough cant recommend this game enough witcheris one of those games that keeps pushing my backlog further and further back"
"some thought needs to go into combat its better than just smashing buttons the storylines so good no wonder theres a tv series now the scenery and gorgeous open world is what made this game truly special for me there were many points where i stopped and admired the view this games worth whatever it costs when you buy it and some morehearts of stone blood and guts are excellent too if youre thinking of getting the expansions overall this game is one of the best of all time and deserves all the success it has"

"is it violent yes is it graphic also yes is there more than enough swearing oh god yes
if any of these three things offend you then its probably best to stay away from this game but if you like games with a well written story line good third person fighting mechanics and an amazing open world then i absolutely recommend this game
you can spend hours just running around the game space discovering places and killing monsters and it wont feel like a waste of time the graphics are good and while every woman looks like she was getting ready for a photoshoot it is surprisingly realistic
the harder game modes are still fun without being soul crushingly hard and no matter what it is a fun game to play
if you didnt choose to romance yennifer you hurt your own game and have no one to blame but yourself"

"tabletop simulator gwent edition is fantastic and has a surprisingly well fleshed out minigame in which you play as an aging father whose freelance pest control business frequently requires you to work withfor people whose politics you may find abhorrent but must put aside for the sake of putting bread on the table for your foster daughter paying the mortgage on your oversized suburban mcmansion and buying new clothes and haircuts as you try to win back your ex the expansions extend the game to include honouring a poorly outlined contract in which you are thoroughly exploited by the client and a retirement endgame in which you move to warmer weather to do some gardening but must survive new neighbours who try to drain what little life remains from you"

"once i start playing i have a hard time stopping which is not something i can say for many other games the amount of morally ambiguous choices that you have to make in the game really make you want to replay the scenes over and over until you feel like youve made the choice that would cause you the least amount of guilt i bought the game of the year edition which came with the hos and bw expansions these expansions are amazing i actually cant say enough good things about them toussaint is an especially beautiful and fun place to exploreit could actually be a whole game of its own if the storyline was even larger while toussaint was an amazing minigame of its own the hos story had so many mysteries and interesting lore about it that it just made me want to read full length books about it definitely recommend i do wish geralt had even more hairstyle and beard options its fun making him look silly sometimes"

"bought the game when it came out loved it to death and stocked abouthours by almost purely sidequesting then it happened the horrid hard drive failure i thought i lost everything and it looks like stream cloud didnt store my save files i was defeated and in the process of buying new pc parts i ended up losing interest in witcherfor some time i just couldnt bring myself to redo all those misc quests and such
but for some reason the gods noticed this mistake and wouldnt leave it unresolved i had found my old backup hard drive and decided to take a gander at the old days obviously the first thing i do it look at old documents and what do i see a folder titled the witcher 

booted it up and i found everything as i left off in the middle of a forest with nearly broken weapons and enough food to fill a man for a year"

"the solo gamers wet dream is what they should call this game wild hunt is more then just a story line in the witcher series its one of the most interactive and immersive games i have ever played when i mean you control the story you literally control the story not all interactions are copy and pastes for everyone this is due to the game having a reaction for every actionyoure choices matter to the world around you hence making this game very complex and in my opinion hopefully valued a masterpiece of a game leading to a multitude of adventures inconvenience fun times and overall good experiences and always entertaining outcomes there is plenty of missions to keep you busy not endless to a perfectionist but definitely enough to keep even the veteran gamer busy for months totally recommended if you dont buy this i suggest you sell youre pc or steam machine and tell no one youre skipping this one because you are missing a absolute essential"

the story is top notch combat is top notch characters main storyline side quests everything about this game is done to perfection
if i had to complain maybe the few bugs but were only funny small bugs and this game seems bug free when compared to skyrim
what cd projekt red pulled off is unbelievable i never felt bored about the world the side quests were all interesting and what saddens me is that i will never be able to experience the feeling of my first time playing this game and i havent even played the other dlc which i had heard were also equally amazing when i play the dlc i will make an edit to this post
 once again i wish i could travel back in time to play this game like it was my first time again this game was most def my best game of the decade for me i just hope that maybe the next witcher game will fix the fall damage"

"sofinally it is time to write my review dear god its been so longabouthours while only following the main story and maybeside quests i will make a tldr before my review for the ones that seek the sum and not the long story
tldr
pros
toss a coin to your witcher
money well spent
nice combat system
huge story
quick thinking on many choicesthat matters
main story requires more thathours
cons
long cinematics
feels chaotic at first
randomly crashes driver problemsnot game bugs
takes to long to complete even just for the main story
sometimes quests felt like a chore
i bought the game and both dlc after i watched the netflix adaptation of the witcher so i came here with only a small fair knowledge about this world for startersthe combat isnt anything to extreme but not to simple either the graphics are quite nice and i am pleased with them the story is hugei mean litteraly huuuugeand i thought skyrim had to many hours of gameplaydont get me wrong i loved the storyline of the game and i got a small hint from a friend on how to play it the right way from the start i wont spoil anything extremely nice storyline soooo many choicesthatmatter and so many answer undersecondschoicesoh my i dont believe i had any game like that so far in my gaming career besteuros ever spenti meaneuroson sale forhours of good gameplay with the side quest it might even take meto complete itmoney well spent for sure enought with the pros and lets get the cons now
although i did love the game and i am definetelly recommending it to any gamer thats has time to spare i got extremely frustrated about the cinematics i mean i get it its a choices matter rpg game butfromhoursonlymaybehours felt like gameplay and all the rest felt like watching a movie with a theme ofpick the right question or this man dies dont get me wrong i did enjoyed it a lot but if i wanted to watch a movie i would just do that and not play a game so if you are a gamer that likes long cinematics you will love it and you will pray for a witcherif you are a gamer like me that likes a beautiful made stories but prefer completing a game in less thathours so that you can pick a new game to play then you have to think about playing this game twice the game has also quite the learning curve feels so chaotic at firstbut after you settle with your gameplay you will find it extremely simple and not confusing at all encountered very few bugs but nothing gamebreakring i had a couple of issues with game crashing but it was a problem with the windows updates and a nvidia drivers problems i found a solution after a while by reverting my drivers to a previous version lastly one of the pros is also a con for my case it takes to long to complete the main storyto longsometimes if feels like they programmed it on purpose to make the game bigger but for my case just got frustratingi even found my self strungling long hours to complete it so i can finally free disk space for a new game you follow the main quests only and suddenly you feel like making to many side quests although thats not the case"

the game doesnt even load half the time and im faced with killing the tasks in task manager
i had an awkward xboxx phase and managed to finish the whole game within a week as i didnt experience a single bug and it looked beautiful granted it was not as beautiful as pc but it was a decent trade off

"its honestly on of the best singleplayer games out there it has excellent graphics amazing views and you can generally do so many things in the game you can either play the main story without any side quests which could prove difficult or you can play the game by doing every side quests or contracts out there if you decide to adopt the second way of playing you could easily puthours in the game including treasure hunts crafting alchemy etc the game can be looked from many sides for me the game was for chilling in your pc at night or in the morning and just enjoying its gameplay but if you want to look at the game more seriously you can either try to finish the game on the hardest difficulties or go for as many achievements as possible in general this game is deffinately worth the time checking"

"ive really tried to like this game but i just couldnt the story and dialog are just boring youre not really playing an rpg here you must play a certain way and make certain decisions in order to get a certain ending thats considered the right choices to me thats forcing my hand basically being a robot it would be one thing to be playing through a characters story its another to craft an illusion of choice on your hands"

"the witcherwild hunt is regarded as the best game ever created by many people but is it true mostly yes but giving a game the title best shouldnt be that easy if youre going to call this the best game then i assume as a customer you know what to expect from a game and the genre it was created for the witcheris an arpg and it nearly meets most of the things youd expect from a perfect arpg game if not the best game its definitly the best arpg ever created and i strongly believe that there is no such thing as the best game since there are many genres out there
what does witcheroffer different from the first two games many things actually first of all its not a linear arpg anymore its open world you have three different huge one decent and one small interior map to explore combat is extremely improved over first two games along with skill tree inventory basically they did a great job with interface design story is also improved along with wellwritten dialogue and script there are also many details that effect the other quests world and characters it might be the most detailed game ive ever played actually which is why it is regarded as the best game
there are many more good things i can write about this game but i really wouldnt want to spoil anything for you you might want to ask the negative sides of the game and ill go over them as well roach our beloved horse has a terrible ai no matter where you call her she will always get stuck or take a long time to get to you you will usually find yourself going for her there are also small bugs that will prevent you from completing certain activities but they are nothing like gamebreaking bugs in fact you wont even notice them last thing im going to mention about the game is that dialogue can get tiring at some points it feels like an interactive movie rather than an arpg most of the time it wouldve been much much better if they had a balance between dialogue and gameplay
thats all i have to say about the witcherwild hunt if youre looking for a wonderful story along with a perfectly balanced gameplay go for it i think everyone should experience this game or at least the witcher universe in their lifetime"

"the best rpg game ever made"
"i have always enjoyed this game and since it is so long and it has been so long it is almost like playing it for the first time again"
"one of the most immersive open world games on the market with plenty of character oozes rich and layered storytelling as well as compelling characters the side quests in particular have well done scenarios that each feel different from one another unfortunately while the story and context surrounding the side quests are very unique the gameplay itself remains very simple and rigid i realize that changing gameplay from one quest to another is not only difficult but entirely unfeasible so that gripe is not a slight toward this game rather its a complaint about all massive open world games which often suffer from gameplay fatigue as a result of their enormity
the witcherwas the game that was praised by many as the greatest game of all time but i was a little worried about starting in the third installment of the franchise my reservations were broken once i started playing as the game in no way expects you to have played the previous games or to have read the books that said there are many references to the older games that could enrich the stories being told had you already been invested in the story"
"berry gud"

"one of the best game i have ever played this game is a masterpiece i have been playing this games since the first game so this final game was a great closure for me one of the greatest fantasy stories ever told even tv shows will shiver at the level of story telling the game can offer its enhanced due to the interactivity that comes with the video game medium
this game is a must have for any fantasy story lover this game is more of a story driven rpg than a combat based rpg the game is shallow in rpg mechanics compared to older games as cdpr dumped it down for mass appeal i played the game using the mod enhanced edition which is a must have mod if one wants a proper rpg progression along with the stellar story
this game is a must buy as its not about the challenge its about making choices and playing inside the universe of witcher series and that is the joy this game brings to the people
a word of warning play witcherif not possible playing witcheris a must have as it takes place after witcherelse a new player will feel alienated and will be missing a lot of pivotal moments and amazing characters the player will also fail to empathize with many of the characters"

"one of the best game ever"
"well this games reputation speaks for itselfquite frankly i dont havea lot to say about it that hasnt been said alreadybut since i want to express my love for this game and cd projekt red i will say somethings i loved about the game lets go
stthe open world is one of the richest i have ever seen it still amazes me how much detail is put it because of a smart decision of splitting it intopartswhich allowed them to focus on detail in each area for exampleyou can instantly tell apart which is novigrad or skellige they do not blend together like cities in assassins origins for example
contentwell its this games biggest strength in my opinion and i will tell you whyunlike a game like odyssey which just tries to extend the game time and tries to make it seem bigger than it really is witcher makes the best of its content side quest for example are the best i ever seenthey are more than fetch quest they expand on characters for example barron quests or following the thread where lambert wants to avenge his friend aiden i could write more but i would be here forever
the story quite honestly story is simple but i mean that in the best way possible because it has a lot of detail and sub plots but they complement each other perfectly i will not go into detail about it because im sure some people havent played it yet and its quite special to experience it blind
well as much that i love the game the combat in this game is not one of my favourite aspects of the game dont get me wrongit works fine as it is just feels a bit sluggish at times especially after playing games like bloodborne or devil may cry or bayonetta but thats my personal preference
well as you can see witcher has a lot to offer and i didnt go into all the details of this game sadly because it just is to much for a written rewiew like i dint even talk about gvent one of the best mini gamesthat spawned a real game thats just amazing
witcher is one of the greats i hope if you havent played it yet you will give it a shot

"i i fell in love"
"look i know this game has won loads of awards and its considered one of the best rpgs of all time i was skeptical because i hated the first two games but this wasso i broke down and bought it im trying to get into it i really am but its just not fun to play id recommend this game because i can see why people would enjoy it and its obvious that love and careful effort went into making it i dont want to discourage you from playing a game you might love but its just not grabbing me let me explain why
 the controls are so clunky that theyre annoying i have to move away from loot to pick it up stand in extremely difficult spots to loot a chest loot flies away from monsters and isnt on the corpse and i have to keep repositioning to find it i have to get either super close or super far away from loot to be able to pick it up loot is a mess and geralt always steps too far he cant make normal steps forward so its hard to position him
 combat isnt fun its annoying some might say its too easy because its just button mashing other people might say you can make it as challenging as you want by preparing oils and using different techniques either way its not fun its just a hackandslash with bad camera angles that make it hard to tell where youre going especially when dodging
 the story has good source material but it lacks substance in the game its like a pie thats all filling and no crust there is so much content through side stories that the main story feels flat the characters feel so developed that they dont need to develop more there isnt a hook to make me interesting the world is well designed the characters are believable the stories feel like a lot of thought went into them but theres no hook in the story to motivate me to keep playing which is bad when i do not enjoy the gameplay otherwise
 to make matters way worse this game is buggy fans seem to accept the bugs and say the good outweighs the bugs sorry no its just annoying when i draw a sword but theres no sword in my hands and no damage is done to monsters restarting the game fixes the bug but then i die i reload my save and then i draw an air sword again watching him swing nothing as if he has an actual sword in his hand reload the game again and finally make it through the dungeon frazzled and annoyed not feeling proud or accomplished
the point of a game is to have fun this game just isnt fun for me maybe im not the target audience and i love rpgs i greatly prefer games like baldurs gate divinity original sin final fantasy elder scrolls games dragon age knights of the old republic you get the idea i think that if the witcherwas an isometric turn based game i would love it it would solve the combat problems increase the strategy and help the story shine"

"this is one of the most intense games that i have ever played the story was hands down amazing living up to the novels reputation you will immediately fall in love with every single character along the way with how well the actors play their parts i loved every minute of it so much that it was one of the only games where i truly had a hard time putting down the controller the fighting was a bit generic with only being able to swing your sword this way and that way following a dodge roll here and a dodge roll there but it honestly didnt even matterthe story and gameplay along with the monsters you hunt made up for it the graphics are also top notch with a huge open world to back it up you will not be disappointed with this purchase"

"i played the witcheron ps and loved it so much that when i got my pc i decided to buy it again on steam because of the better graphics and let me tell you i really wish i had never even bought it on ps it looks so amazing on pc its incredible
story is pretty good but the combat looting and magic system are the best gameplay all around is really addicting but to be fair it is really hard to get into at first especially if you are a fromsoft veteran like myself once you level up and get better armor swords hp all that good stuff it is really hard not to love this game
could do without having to choose what to say all the time but you learn to not mind it that is just my opinion it wouldnt be the witcher without selected response however so ill leave that one be

i love the character and the nondumb morale there is no best choice like in mass effect only decisions with compromises you have to make and achieving the best imho ending for this game is not trivial sincerely
also the two dlcs hearts of stone and blood and vines are excellent i highly recommend that you end your playthrough with the blood and vines dlc as it makes the most sense"

thats all that has to be said here
but really this game is a true joy to play however if combat is the main selling point of a game for youskip this one the story is unrivaled but geralt needs a bit more training to compete with other rpgs combat systems
highly recommend but make sure you take it slow the first time through you only get to experience it for the first time once"

however it is absolutely not worthdollarsyears later and the dlcs do not work with geforce nowget it from a from a less fancy distribution service i got it forbucks a few months back

"i see this game as a blend between sacred skyrim and assassins creed the theme looting system and ui remind me of sacred the atmosphere and scope of the game remind me of skyrim and the superb story and combat system reminds me of assassins creed
only negative i can think of is the clunky movement of your character which can get anyone as you played for a few dozen hours
but aside from that i promise you that this game is a treat especially when youre into discovering a whole new fantasy world where your choices actually impact the multiple stories in the game a little bit like the telltale games"

"replayability for this game is insane had finish the game on both pc and ps and still couldnt get enough of it gwent mini game is amazing and the fact that it has a standalone game based on this just shows how amazing it iswould recommend"
"comparing the witcher to the witcher ii to the witcher iii is like comparing poop to chocolate to a deluxe hot fudge ice cream sundae basically the evolution of this series has been incredible
the story to the third game is much more straightforward than the last outing as it focuses on telling itself through the eyes of individual characters like geralt and ciri rather than from a birds eye political perspective basically every decision you make feels like it affects you more than it does the entire kingdom do not take this to mean however that these decisions feel less important or impactful they actually feel more essential than in previous installments because they feel more personal i care much more about my friends and family for example than i do about a kingdom ive never visited this also leads to some difficult moral decisionschoices which can have varying consequences sure some decisions you make are in hindsight black and white but most have some pretty significant trade offs that really make you question what the right decision truly was the only real major problem i had with the main storyline was the constant introduction of characters i didnt know but geralt did despite having played through the entire second game and watching play throughs and story recaps of the first game basically if you dont read the books or in some cases watch the netflix series then you will be completely lost as to who a character your talking to is why they are important and why you should care about them going forward the side quests are where the game shines in story telling as they each have their own twists and turns and mini moral quandries that shape the world in unique ways
the games maps is huge the initial area you are dropped in is a bit underwhelming but once you complete the prologue the world opens up in a big way and is incredibly easy to get lost in the combat is pretty straightforward and while not incredible it is serviceable and there is enough variety in enemy types to keep every type of encounter feeling fresh my biggest problem with the combat is there really only feels like one way to play and there isnt much room for experimentation
the graphics for the game are impressive for the time and the voice acting finally feels fully realized and solid although some voice actors repeat over too much for my taste the sound design for the game is also vastly improved as is the music
some other points of notepieces of advice
play gwent its a pretty addicting and fun experience and can really help you out in a few points in the story
complete white orchards story asap because the world will feel a bit underwhelming otherwise
get the complete edition the hearts of stone main quest line is my favorite of the entire game while blood and wine adds a ton of content and a new area
double check what save you import decisions in the previous entry dont affect the game hardly at all here but the fate of a few characters is wrapped up if you decide to import just be sure you download the last autosave not manual
get witcher armorweapons they are easily the best in the game until you get to the end of the dlcshours in
complete as many side quests as possible before the isle of mists main mission because some will get locked out after it is completed
be careful how you handle ciri at the end of the game it plays a big role in the ending
seriously get this game it is one of the best ive ever played"

"before purchasing the steam version ini already smashed the game and all its dlc on the ps on its launch platnium trophy so i know my way around but it was still an immense pleasure to play through it again on pc and for the modest price ofgoty edition
if you didnt know already you play as geralt a witcher who travels around accepting contracts to slay monsters and the nonhuman hey witchers gotta eat the main story tasks you with finding a women called ciri who is like a daughter to geralt from a bunch of elves dressed in some badass armour called the wild hunt ciri is special she has elder blood which has given her abilities like travelling to other worlds and doingsome cool teleporting whilst fighting you play as her occasionally which was awesome and i hope she is the main protagonist in a future witcher game there is also a ton of side missions and some of those storys rival the main game imo when playing as geralt you gotswords steel for humans silver for monsters which can be upgraded along with chest legs hands and feet you also have a trusty steed called roach who you can upgrade via saddlebags a trophy etc so you can carry more loot and a buff geralt can also use some magic called signs which again can be upgraded to be more powerful and have alternative functions igni the fire spell can be used as a quick blast or a continuous stream of fire there is a variety of things to do apart from the mainside quests like horse racing and the very very good mini game called gwent its a card gameafter you have been through the mammoth main game there isdlc which are every bit as good as the main game but i must say in my opinion that blood and wine is the better of the two because of the location the bright colours and the fairytale characters that make an appearancei could write about this game till my keyboard keys starts to fade so ill end this here so you the reader can enjoy the game without me spoiling anymore for youi have just sunk inhours on this masterpiece and withachievements and i did not want it to end i cannot wait for cd projekt reds new game cyberpunk"

love this game its beautiful well made lots of content very playable with a wide variety of monsters and lootleveling is actual work as is scraping money together spenthours playing the first dayhours after finishing thehour download
however
 its best to have played the other two witchers first i did notwas drawn to this one for the open world style
 the main character is whipped as that they used to say hes heroic and strong yes but hes pathetic when it comes to women he follows yennefer around like a puppy as she treats him like dung strings him along uses her sxuality to manipulate and control him with doubtful faithfulness on her own part and leaves him generally unloved and without her companionship then he chases another hyperalpha woman around while bootlcking witchessorceresses in general
 cant alter his appearance beyond very limited hair and beard alterations and armor choices are often quite ugly if perhaps more historically accurate in the medieval or renaissance sensethinning white hair sharp scarred facial features and cateyes not my thing but sure it appeals to others

"i have played this game ever since it came out recommend playing on death march this is the only way to play the game because it will give a better challenge to the ai the only thing bad about the game is that if you want to play the dlcs you will have to rank up pastthis turns the game into a shopping list of things you need to do so that you can have any chance defeating the ai other then that the main story line has had me playing for years first had this game on xbox than pc"

youll get it once youplay it"
"i love this game series for many reasons this title has breathtaking graphics even with todays standards the story is better if you have played the previous games they usually come in a bundle from the developers which is nice there is hardly any glitches in the game smooth gameplay and combat fun missions ive really enjoyed the base game and the dlc"
"like a more polished less drab looking skyrim not without bugs but nothing gamebreaking as far as ive seen just the occasional horse sliding backwards down a hill and an enemy orcoming through a wall story is fun to play though and a bunch of systems to conquer so its got plenty of replayability would definitely recommend if you have time on our hands"

"ive lost count of how many times ive replayed this game"

"the witcheris a great expansion to the witcher series
truly amazing game
graphics are good
gwent
always more story to follow which is very easy to immerse yourself in
gwent
a large variety of weapons and armor
gwent for sure
it adds a big open world as well as a branching story with multiple ending based on choices made in the game
every quest feels important not just the main quests
and last but not least something many rpgs cant seem to get right fighting monsters remains suspenseful for the whole of the game especially on higher difficulty even the monsters lurking aside the streets and dirt roads will hurt you and fighting the more dangerous monsters is actually more of a boss fight than the go kill ten creeps quests we get in other games"

"i feel ashamed to admit that i played this game just recently never bothered before to play it because the setting is normaly nothing for me i brought the game with all dlcs in some sale last year ago and when i was sick at home i started it and what should i say i couldnt stop
everything was so overwhelming the graphics even after the many years after release the character design the synchro i stayed with the english one because the german one is not bad at all but it reminds me a little bit of bad porn actors the huuuuuge amount of quests and things to do no side quest or contract feels boring like in other open world gamessome have the feeling of additional main quests
due to the different choices you have makes the game replayable
so i just not only played this game through for the last weeks nope i also directly started a ng run
i was sceptical about cyberpunk because it is also not my setting but after the witcher hell yeah count me in"

"afterhours and many attempts over the years ive finally finished the witcherfor the first time i feel like its difficult to say what i want to say about this game given its acclaim and influence but ill try my best anyway
the witcherhas an incredible level of detail variety and content which are easily its strongest points the sheer amount of side quests and contracts with interesting stories surprises and challenges of their own is incredible there are very few games which rival the side content in this game yakuzacomes to mind the red dead redemption games are up there too in terms of consistency and quality
the environments are stunning the music is fantastic and i am genuinely very impressed with how many different monstersbeasts there are in the game i love that after a while you can tell what monster youll be facing before you even face them based on contextual clues and hints that makes the game immersive in the sense that you feel like a witcher you know what youre most likely facing and what you need to do to defeat it
i will name some negatives i experienced throughout my time with witcherthey need to be said because to claim the game is perfect or without flaws would be stupidly biased for starters there are a lot of bugs still physics bugs are rampant mostly during cutscenes i couldnt tell you how many times a necklace or bag started flying around the screen during a cutscene then theres clipping issues that also occur a lot both of these graphical issues can really dampen the intensity of a scene
the game also has shocking antialiasing swords pendants certain armors and enemies are way too shiny and jaggy i messed around with every setting imaginable and only managed to improve it for the most egregious of the bunch apparently with p monitors its less noticeable and in k its not noticeable at all unfortunately not everyone has that kind of setup and the game couldve done with some improvement graphically in that regard
there are also a fair few gameplay bugs when facing the second last boss of the game i had to reload a save because he just stood there stiff as a board taking my attacks i also had a bug where my horse despawned and couldnt respawn no matter if i fast traveled went into a building and came out etc
certain skills are also completely broken puppet simply doesnt work if you have delusion activated other skills also have no effect or half the effect the description states on top of that i had to restart the game because a visual filter that was applied during one scene wasnt unapplied and it was making the game flicker like crazy where it was unintended
moving forward past those negatives and i will say they are mostly minor inconveniences i found the main story to be fairly unexciting it has its moments and certainly picks up the pace around the ndrd act but before that it moves very slowly adding to that the side quests feel like theyre punchier wilder and more engaging than at least half of the games main quests
it probably sounds like im not that amazed or blown away by the game which is and isnt true i think the witcherdoes some things excellently the environments side questscontracts mechanics world building etc are all top notch and are worthy of every bit of praise the game has received but the main plot i would describe as serviceable to good not much more than that i personally wish the tone was darker and the writers took more risks
of course your mileage may vary and im probably more critical than most the witcheris still absolutely a worthwhile game packed full of high quality varied content that the majority of aaa games wish they could boast of im still keen to play more of the games contracts and go through the expansions which i havent yet touched
my feeling is that the witcheris a great game with plenty of noteworthy and memorable moments but its also guilty of playing it too safe in parts which held it back from being truly brilliantfrom me"
"bloody good stuff"
"my wife hates this game"
"straight up ive been playing warframe for years its rare that a game can derail my warframe grind for as long as this game diddoes just in sidequests please buy it"

"the world of the witcher is a very well conceived one right down to the detail of the lore and the ancient languages spoken by the fictitious worlds inhabitants the storyline is more than richits exuberant with details of historical events backstories for quests factions within races political systems underground organisations familial heritage and romantic engagements
the developers did a fine job with the immersive elements such as environmental effects reactions from the populace and the main protagonists interactions with the environment the game world is just enormous so thank goodness there are fasttravel options if youre not too distracted by the beautiful scenery you might get a little preoccupied with gwenta cardbased minigame that echoes other character tradingcard games like dd or pokmon
combat is very open to tactics where the player can use any combination of swordplay which can be enhanced with runes to give additional effects oils which can be applied to weapons for bonus damage to specific species signs an innate magical ability of witchers bombs the crossbow chevaliery horsemanship the environment such as gas clouds explosive barrels bees and geology buildings bodies of water etc to bring destruction to his enemies
in summary i would definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys singleplayer firstperson rpgs but be warned it will demand hundreds of hours of your life fantastic valueformoney though
there are a few enhancements id like to see
 countdowns on timed quests
 combat hints such as dodge parry counter etc
 monster weakness icons if in bestiary
 a more extensive soundtrack
maybe in the next witcher the main character could suffer other physical effects such as fatigue hunger corpulence or broken bonespossibly affecting the character differently depending on whats broken"

"overall for a solo rpg i give witcherai dont do reviews really but this game deserves one
pros
combatthe combat feels natural and smooth for an action rpg this is so important input lag or wonky enemy hit boxes really takes me out of the moment
musiclol i am talking about game
since when has game music been worth mentioning in a reviewwellits worth it here in witcheri freaken love the game musicall of the time a lot of games have good scores during certain cut scenes or events you enter an epic boss fight or an especially traumatic thing happens like one of the main characters dies in witcherthe music is just awesomeall the timeperiod
questsi feel like most rpgs and mmos i have played have a ratio of aboutstupid quests andrelevant feeling quests go get me candlesthey stole our candles can you please walkyards right over there and pick stupid berries i just cant do it myself i feel like witcheris more along the lines ofrelevant quests andstupid quests to me relevant means i am doing this because the npc actually needs help and they just cant do it for themselves witcherdoes a really good job of making you feel genuinely needed not just a stupid errand boy
storymost games do their best to give you a good main story and some background lore but a lot goes unexplained witchertakes story to the next level it explains everything but the explanation is a natural part of the world and the effect is so immersive to me immersion is everything a game that looks great with great combat that has flaws severe enough to break my immersion in to the game and story will lose my interest quickly witchermakes you feel like you are in a living world that you can lose yourself in for hours and not even realize it
cons
sound effectsi spoke earlier about immersion some of the sound effects are out of place or just dont sound right and they take me out of the moment my best example is when the wind is blowing in the forest they tried to make the sound of tree limbs hitting each other during high wind but it sounds more like a couple of broom sticks being banged together
overall this game is awesome the worst thing that i dont like really isnt that big a deal i would recommend this game to anyone who likes action rpgs or action mmos"

"game of the decade"
"i dont know what to say that hasnt been said lots of content great story tons of fun im not a hardcore fan and i will say it took a long time for geralt to grow on me and some of the other characters annoyed me for a long time after a while though i started to get a little more into the lore and the world and once that happened i think all of my previous grievances seemed to fall away and understanding took its place if you like open world games and lots of questing and a pretty ng deckbuilder card game with a heavy side of intensely good story then play this game i didnt play the firsttried but man they didnt age well but with a little help from the wiki pages and the old google magic i have pieced togethera pretty solid understanding of the past events highly recommend"

"hours and i still have a dozen or more treasure hunts the very last quest of the main plot lord knows how many waypoints to uncover in just about every area still and the entirety of blood and wine to complete im not at all tired of the game yet and in fact im already looking forward to my second play through i didnt play the first two games havent watched the show or read the books but ive been able to keep up with the story well enough there is just endless amounts of dialog most is optional and lore books to go through to get you up to speed
owned the game for years and never played because i didnt own a controller i truly believe the game is unplayable with a mouse and keyboard controls took a little bit to get the hang of as well because there is a lot to do but after the firsthours or so it felt natural
i play on a pretty low end computer so i experience quite a few graphic glitches here and there models tposing or spinning or whatever but nothing game breaking so far
those are the only two negative things i have to say about the game and honestly it has more to do with my own hardware than the game itself im really tempted to buy the game for the switch since it has save transfer im not going to go over all the good things in the game because im sure its all been said before"

"you all know why i gave this game a positive review its the witcherenough has been said but to explain why i give this a positive review should be quite clear this game is ages ahead everyone else when it comes to being a good rpg the characters are all amazingly well made and have depth something falloutlacked
the open world is vast almost too big and leaves a lot of options and side content to explore not related to the main story the world is fleshed out with encounters and witcher contracts for you to take to play the part of a witcher and truly feel how it is to be one the dialogue is good and straight to the point something mass effect andromeda lacked with theiryear old dialogue
the combat is decent and almost downright great the only thing holding it back is that you get stuck in a habit of using quen and just going in and hittingif you play a particular playstyle the game doesnt really try to help players play in a more diverse playstyle which i think can make combat repetetitive but this is still incomparably good to skyrims appalling combat
so all in all this game is a near perfect mix of all components that make up an rpg and that is why it is still the bestyears after its release thank you for reading"
"its ok"
"best rpg"
"the story in this game is so ing good"
"one of the greatest rpgs ive ever played
not a very controversial opinion obviously
excellent and engaging stories interesting lore fun roleplaying and dialogue options choices actually matter
goodbut kinda overrated see below
definitely many issues however
combat is afor likeof game crossbow enemy stun moves combat movespeed cant jump in combat and arachnomorphs good examples
storytelling in certain areas is arailroaded shani romance lack of clues for good ending in blood n wine and white frost are good examples
game sometimes struggles to reconcile the books and its own canon ciriavallach is a good example
 trisss character totally made up to try and make it so she competes with yennefer for game purposes
 ng boring as heck
all in all extremely good game but not the best rpg of all time like some people argue
just play the damn thing either way"

down sidei wish i could use console commands with gefrocenow maybe they will update it"
"its a horrible game to get into just before exams because its hard to stop playing and start studying
im usually not one for open world games and even less open world rpgs i often feel like in other similar games the side quests are repetative time fillers that dont add to the game except add some more time and a ton of time is usually spent on just travelling instead of playing
this cant be said about the witcherits an immersive world where each quest is different the stories are interesting and the gameplay is too instead of being a distraction the side quests and contracts make sense as part of the story they help build the characters and motivations and the world they inhabit never does it feel like a generic time filler
i took a long time to give this game a chance because ive not been a fan of similar games in the past but my only three regrets are that i waited this long that i started it when i was supposed to be studying and that im not playing it on a more proper machine where i could enjoy the graphics more"

"when a humble bard
graced a ride along
with geralt of rivia
along came this song
from when the white wolf fought
a silvertongued devil
his army of elves
at his hooves did they revel
they came after me
with masterful deceit
broke down my lute
and they kicked in my teeth
while the devil horns
minced our tender meat
and so cried the witcher
he can be bleat
toss a coin to your witcher
o valley of plenty
at the edge of the world
fight the mighty horde
that bashes and breaks you
and brings you the morn
he thrust every elf
far back on the shelf
high up on the mountain
from whence it came
he wiped out your pest
got kicked in his chest
he a friend of humanity
so give him the rest
that my epic tale
a champion prevailed
defeated the villain
now pour him some ale
toss a coin to your witcher
o valley of plenty
toss a coin to your witcher
and friend of humanity"

"well what praise has this not yet received cant argue with any of it"
"rich addictive and unique in its own way
there is not much i can complain about i would really recommend it to everyone
a few things which in my opinion need improvements
 the crossbowshooting is very limited especially in terms of the range it feels like it was a closecombat crossbow which you cannot use on farther distances actually you will find out that there is absolutely no need for a crossbow and it is not fun to shoot it even skillswise you don feel too much need or willingness to develop the skills improving the effectiveness of your crossbow i think it intended to be only a secondary weapon however you don feel you want to use it so often on the other hand it useful underwater then againlimited and bland
 pornyou have kids you might want to know that this game is full of porn content dialogues as a player i personally don enjoy it when a game forces you to go through erotic plots so often in order to advance in the story in addition there are plenty of npcs walking around in major towns in skimpy outfits and with even skimpier language commenting your character all the time in purely sexual manner i find it annoying and pornalike not in my taste for a game get a hooker or a porn in real life instead of getting excited while playing too distractive and awkward for me i have played a lot of games and this is the first time i found the sexual content too intensive distracting and annoying
 playing cardsnot enjoyable in my opinion it is also frustrating that once you choose to play the cards with a character you are forced to complete it and you cannot exit from time to time i selected the wrong dialogue option and needed to play through this boring card game
all in all a beautiful world to discover and lots of fun unique polish lore comparing to somewhat repetitive anglosaxon or japanese lores we have been seeing for so many years in gaming industry"

"its the witcher what more can you say"
"epic"
"ive never been a fan of fantasy medieval themed games but this one is a true gem im not a hardcore gamer so i find combat quite difficult on the easiest setting is challenging enough for me doesnt feel grindy and the story is unlike anything ive experienced it is truly a must have and get the dlcs"

"the first time that i played witcherwas without knowing nothing about the previous games or even the books it was a fantastic experience with the glossary which has a detailed description of the characters from main quests and side quests it has even the description about the beasts weaknesses and strengths ingame the world is just breathtaking due to the help of graphics music and the context of each zone of the game such as velen a zone devasted by war novigrad the big city with casinos banks and brothels skellige people of the sea with strong traditions and toussant wine knights and vampires
the narrative doesn lose coherence duringhours of gameplay due to an excellent work among the zones quests and the open world itself each time that i start a new game it feels fresh and i can try new buildings in combat explore each corner in the vast world or just change the endings of quests affecting the fate of many characters i haven explored skellege undiscovered zones in the sea because of the sirens as an excuse to come for a fifth playthrough in the future even after a fourth playthrough i still finding new quests endings and rewards
if you fancy movies books and videogames you will find all together in the witcheras free content the amount of content is almost endless there are mini books about almost each topic of this vast universe such as zones characters and traditions there are many cutscenes and conversations ingame that help to develop the storyline bringing a worthy experience i don regret nothing about the time that i spent in the witcher universe including gwent thronebreaker and the eight books were gorgeous while i was playing reading and enjoying themi will be waiting for a new game in the witcher universe a new book or even the new season of the witcher show if cyberpunk game is half as good as the witcherit will be worthy to play it so i am waiting for it too"
"one of the rare games i would physically force somebody to play if they outright refused to"
"good rpg"
"its a game"
"great game no questions needed"
"a lot of game for your buck side missions feel like there was some thought put behind them instead of just something tacked on for additional play time just a good rpg with a good minigame in gwent if you like scenic worlds with good swordplay action and enjoy story this game is probably up your alley"

"its a good game"
"this game is awesome"
"i enjoy the story and the combat system look up a guide though for builds or itll be a bad time late game"
"the best rpg ive played to date full of excellent story and meaningful choices
it has a few bugs and some mechanics can be a little clunky but its definitely worth overlooking those to experience this masterpiece"
"lengthy yet classy"
"i think this game has won every award so one more review probably isnt going to make a difference but basically yes this is one of those rare games that actually lives up to the hype
my advice for maximum fun
 dont be afraid of playing on the medium or even easy but that is a bit too easy difficulty first timeearly ona lot of the forums seem populated by tryhard bros but if you just wanna blast around the story then its not bad to enjoy yourself or if youre a bit of a fan of the soulsborne glutton for punishment style then you can turn it up and feel the painbut honestly its not as rewarding in that front at least for me so wombling along on medium is entertainment enough
 mods are your friendthe mod manger from nexus is great and if nothing else i personally just prefer being henry cavilleveryone else just looks wrong now fcr is also a good mod if you want to keep mostly to the spirit of the game but with a few quality of life improvements
 play with a controller this game was built with one in mind as far as i can tell and the mousekeyboard controls are sketchy at best and a cursed fingerdestroyer of twisted pinkies and weird bindings at worse ive connected a ps controller and it plays like a dream
 this game is massive in a good way so i dunno get someone to hold your calls for a few weeks and for the love of the gods dont buy it near a significant others birthday the just one more contract draw is real hence why im writing a review at am three hours after i meant to go to bed"

"very similar playstyle to other popular titles like skyrim the pc version has console commands if you are into that sort of thing the story is interesting the characters are entertaining and overall i quite enjoyed my time playing this game if i had one disagreeable issue with the game it it wasnt as engaging as i hoped it would be for a new player to the witcher series in many ways i felt confused and wanted to know more about the lore and in therelatively few hours i plaid i am not sure i got enough oh and i hate forced participation in the mini game gwent seriously had to do some of my own investigative work outside of the game to understand better why certain things matter or why certain relationships between characters were the way they are after which i felt much more comfortable playing the game because there was a foundation to build on i feel the game could have improved in that area overall recommend especially for fans of the series and newcomers might need to do a bit of research but should still enjoy the game"
"easily one of my favorite rpgs on any platform"
"at times it can be slow paced but overall a great game with story lines that are memorable combat is good i recommend just buying all the expansions if you have not played this game yet"
"game of the decade"
"this game is one of the best if not the best rpg game out there and you can clearly realize this by seeing its sales numbers game was released inand still feels like ahead of its generation ive bought this game ondifferent platforms and currently doing a third run just because of how beautiful it is and how intriguing the story is you just want more and more out of it the dlcs managed to satisfy the hunger left by the main game and i might even dare say that blood and wine slightly outmatches the quality of the base game which is such a rare occasion for a dlc to be made such wonderfully and given that much detail and attention to it the way the story unfolds the immersion that it gives you in its own world the atmosphere the music the way you connect with the characters its something that ive never felt before in any other game the combat might be the only letdown but it can be so easily ignored by what i described above after finishing this game i can hardly find any other rpg game that has such a gripping story its like every other game has become mediocre for me i cant wait to see what the next installments are going to bring and last but not least if youve never played or heard this game before youre missing out it doesnt matter if youre not a fan of rpgs this game will make you one"
"one of the best games ever play it or youre missing out"

"really really great game"
"i just started playing this game on pc again after only finishing it once on console back when it first released also playing both hearts of stone and blood and wine this game has me hooked yet again im not one to replay the same games over and over again but i like to come back to some of my favorites after awhile of not playing them i always considered this game to be one of my favorites of all time but after playing it again i think im convinced this is my favorite of all time it just does so many things so well when i first played this game i hadnt yet played the first two games although not necessary to enjoy this game it does help you understand what is going on in the story a bit more as it is a continuation of the previous games in the series now that i have played the first two games i feel like im enjoying the experience that much more
the main draw to this game is obviously the story and the characters but i always see people bashing the combat in this gamebut i think its actually fun sure its not the best of any game out there but it more than does the job and it can be very satisfying especially when geralt does a finishing move on an enemy its so sick there is also alot you can do with using potions oils and signs to mix it up so its not just spam one button to win id recommend playing on the higher difficulties so you can truly get everything out of the combat systems
i think what this game does the best though is incorporating all its story elements from main quests to the littlest of side quests into a massive open world game its so well done its what all open world rpgs should strive to be imo but most rarely succeed like the witcherdoes there is an insane amount of things to do in this game it can kind of get overwhelming at some points but in a good way not many games offer this much content for the money they are asking for it this game is easily worthdollars even just for one playthrough and you can get the complete edition with both massive dlcs for like half that at its normal price which is insane
the dlc expansions in this game are also very impressive hearts of stone is a good additional story to the game but blood and wine could literally be a whole other game itself its probably the best piece of dlc that you can buy in any game ever it adds a whole new location to the game and a whole new storyline and sidequests its crazy it was onlydollars when it came out not many developers toady will give you that much content for that low of a price seriously its bigger than most full games that come out today like easily days of gameplay time
cd project red has to be one of if not the most respectable game developers out there you can really tell they care about their games theyre not out there just to milk every last cent out of people like most companies now a days its too bad we cant have more people like them making games i also cant wait for cyberpunkim sure it will be great as well ill gladly pay full price for any game they release they deserve it
this game is in no way perfect no game is but if somehow you havent already played this phenomenal game or you have yet to finish it i must implore that you do it will take awhile to get through everything this game has to offer but you wont regret it"
"every few years a work like the witcherwild hunt comes along with impressive technology and a wellwritten story to set the bar higher and stand as one of the greats in gaming history this game has certainly made its impact on gaming
its an amazing game one of my favorites you follow geralt of rivia on his search for his surrogate daughter ciri on a job for her actual father emhyr var emreis emperor of nilfgaard the game is a very deep dive into the northern kingdoms their politics the war with nilfgaard and general life there the story is great with a lot of choices available and fantastic dialogue
the witcheris really immersive yes i know its a buzzword used by many games in their marketing but this one truly feels immersive whether youre playing on one of the easier difficulties without any preparation for fights or use of the mechanics or youre on death march with a heavy focus on things like crafting and fighting the witcherreally makes you feel like geralt this game has kept me playing for hours on end not even stopping to eat its one of the only games thats actually immersed me so hard it distracts me from things i need to do to survive
the art and graphics is very good with each region feeling very different and natural the witcheris a technical marvel in this aspect with very good use of graphical technology in showing its world and its characters the animations are sometimes repetitive but you stop noticing it when youre sucked in
the music and sound is also great the music itself works well and it works even better when its combined with the world the voice acting is good and you never feel like youre in a game when you talk to the characters everything about it is incredibly memorable
the game is very long with several dozens of hours of a campaign and even more in the dlcs aroundhours each but it never feels boring ill probably be replaying this game a lot in the coming yearsi simply just cant put it down and forget it"
"an absolute work of art
this game will forever be a benchmark for those in its genre for years down the road
 worth replaying again and again"

get the dlcs because more skill choices are added from the start the map menu equipment horse riding swimming are all clunky and lack some the feature a player might want the story monsters and romance carries the game along a great world of lore to get into when you need one
also witcheringame gwent card game is not the same as the separate gwent card game which surprised me"

"most amazing game i have played in a long time extense universe and very rich story"
"love the open world and story some of the combat is a little slow over time but overall a great game"

beautifull graphics good and long story i played outhours with dlc and i think one of the best things in witchera background musicits amazing i love it i really hope cd projekt will make a new witcher game after the cyberpunk
i recommend this game to everyone"
"it a masterpiece"
"extemely long and tons of fun"
"the best game ever classic"
""
"cool gamez"
"what i have to say has already been mostly covered by other reviews but lets repeat
the game is simply boring there is little freedom in your choices and all sense of exploration gets nullified by placinmarkers at places of interest even the crafting system is redundant since you regain all spent potions on meditation i thought i would make the game interesting by playing on the highest difficulty but all it did was up the enemies stats making the already bad combat system only last longer i cant defeat certain braindead ai because their health regen is higher than my dps im sure the story wouldve been interesting if i ever wouldve came that far and the graphics and music are beautiful too bad the game feels like a chore to play though"
"this game woke up rpg devs enough said good job poland"
"game is totally confusing what you have to go through to level up is ridiculous assassins creed odyssey is much better and easier to follow i dont care how many awards this game has won what a waste of money if you are not into crafting this game is not for you"
"way better than expected memorable characters and a good story make this one of my fav rpgs right now i was not that impressed with the graphics but okay a few twists quick responses different outcomes keep things fresh hope you enjoy i did"
"just a fun open world game a bit too much storyline for me"
"if you like fantasy story and fast paced rewarding combat little hard to get into but so very very worth it"

"fantastic
the controls were a challenge at firstit took me a while to set up my keyboard and there are some combinations that are not practicalhowever i got the hang and now i enjoy the dancelike combat
the game is also thoughtfully designed to encourage me into the stories instead of strictly focusing on leveling upits good i recommend as clearly do many"
"a world worth getting lost in
so this is actually my second time playing through this game originally i picked it up upon release on ps and had and amazing time with it then as well however due to whatever reasons i never did beat the game so when a sale came around i decide it was finally time to pick this game back up on pc and beat it i am extremely happy i did the story alone it really strong and worth experiencing alone however the multitude of side quests and quality of these side quests are the true gem they arent just recycled fetch quests like youll experience in other triple a games of this size theres actually meat and content to side quests that other studios should take note of side note i would sayof side quests fall into this category lets talk about size as well the play area is huge with for the most part realized areas worth exploring this is a world youll want to explore the nooks and crannies of as the developers did a great job of placing items of interest in remote of the beaten path locations all of this is just coming from the experience of the base game all well as ive yet to touch the dlc this game could easily still warrant aprice tag for the time and content and most importantly quality of content
with everything said so far its time to hit on the negatives youll encounter bugs for sure i have a few crashes during my play time so thats something id look out for and possibly change the auto save timer tomins to ensure you dont lose a heavy amount of progress gwent as well while not a bad aspect of it it definitely isnt the brightest star of this game to myself and makes it a little meh that youll have a handful of quests left over should you ignore this side of the game
all in all though cdpr has a golden recipe for open world experiences that many top tier studios need to study to keep fans engaged for their franchise im beyond excited for the next iteration of cdpr open world gaming and painfully wait for cyberpunk"
"i liked that you can play this game over and over and it will be different each time plus if you are tired of dealing with other players in a game this is great as you play the game alone"
"yes"
"just incredible a work of art"
"great game"
"after attempting to play through the game ondifferent occasions i like many others came back to this game with a revived vigor after watching netflixs the witcher having less thanhours before starting the playthrough i played overbefore finally calling it beating the story and delving a bit into the expansions
needless to say i had a great time the story is pretty good the combat is fun and the insane amount of side content kept me going for a while the choices you have to make in the story actually seem to have consequences and affect the story because well they do finding a game where your choices actually have real weight to them is hard to find and i did not expect to find that this game does that pretty well
the netflix series was amazing and gave me the energy to actually complete a playthrough of the game without getting burned out this was a phenomenal gaming experience one that isnt for everyone but if you are a fan of these style of games skyrim other games like skyrim because im just blanking right now i highly recommend this there is easilyhours of gameplay in a single run of this game with both expansions easily warranting buying the game at full price even"

"a masterpiece that i left way too long to play
as someone whos not a fan of fantasy games bar zelda i was incredibly sceptical about the witcher regardless of how many people had recommended the game to me zelda is somewhat the exception to the rule for me as ive played it since my childhood ive got a fondness of the game and the entire universe within i had always thought that as fantasy games go zelda would be the only one to really catch my eye
the witcherchanged this completely this game not only has hundreds of hours of playable content its exciting rewarding as you progress through the expansion pass adds a new city to explore and delve into and every step of the entire game is fantastic character progression is great upgrading geralts kit everything about it made me want to play more i cant say more good things about this game its fantastic and is now one of my topgames of all time"

"love it stil now in"
"im honestly not sure if ive had more fun playing a game in my life aside from zelda breath of the wildwitcherwild hunt is arguably the best single player game of the decade
the story is phenomenal the characters are lovable the mechanics feel really solid and its just all around beautiful if youve got a rig that can handle it
this is game design at its finesthowever i have a few problems with the main questlineat times the repetitive nature can be rather tiresome at timesbut overall its worth playing through fully because its really excitingthe sidewitcher quests really make up for the repetitiveness of it theres so much story to be discovered and so many monsters to fight
my other gripe is for me not having played any of the other witcher games the ability upgrade system felt rather overburdensometheres so many options for upgrades that its hard to choose what to go withbut once you get to a certain level you should have enough various upgrades that you can swap certain ones in and our depending on your situation
i cannot put into words how much fun this game isi feel as though it should still be listed as agame even five years after releaseat the same time you shouldnt feel like you need to get it immediately its worth to wait for a sale especially if its bundled with the dlcswhich are insanely good and ill post a review on each one in the future

"ive played the base game through twice now playthroughs several years aparti came back to this to experience the hearts of stone and blood and wine expansions and after all that time playing it seemed churlish not to write a review
its a great game but you dont need me to tell you thatmany other reviewers have given it the thumbsupits beautiful immersive gripping dramatic funny movingthe expansions are good too i recommend the whole kit and kaboodle
it has its issuesswimmingunderwater is frequently annoying but perhaps that works to make risky diving actually seem like a feat to pull offtargeting is frequently a bit dodgy played with a controllerinventory management even with the stash is frequently tedious and the stash was just exceedingly slow to access with any modest amount of stuff in therethe game is huge so much stuff to doif you just play to churn through everything to finish everything i suspect it would largely feel like a chore but switching attitude to just enjoying the various adventures and sidetracks along the way makes it quite a different experiencequite a few of the secondary quests are meaty enough to be savoured on their own merits without worrying about how it gets you to the endnot all of themtheres a bunch of nothing quests and stories with potential that perhaps just arent realized very wellbut theres so much good stuff here that i find it impossible to be negative about this experience
a massive effort that pays off magnificently and gives geralt a worthy sendoff"

one other thingthey dont even know that their time played clock is totally wrongand they base their refunds on it
the game doesnt run at all and i am no debutante in computersi still respect the makers of witcherno one makes a game like that unless they know what they are doing and they caresteam on the other hand from the beginning looked exactly like it has proven to beuseless money grabbers

the gameplay is goodjust goodid put it below skyrim in terms of actual open world experience but where this game excels is the writing my geralt had a fulllength conversation with a pig and then helped a cobbler escape from a bunch of rock trolls who were obsessed with shoes
i have no idea whats coming next in this game and thats the best thing about it"

"the witcherwild hunt a true masterpiec i am stopping you there
self to note the game has a good story thats not the bad part
the introduction of the game was good the option for if you want the basics of the combat and magic casts or not was a good thing
i got hooked into the game but the more i progressed the less i wanted to play it
i travled into the town with my companion then some cutscenes then i got my first objective
i began exploring the town meet some guards that didnt liked i drawed my sword i liked that thing it adds some immersion i gotta say but then i accidently stole an item in front ofa npc in his hero he didnt react then i thought why didnt i get accussed of stealing then i stole another item another another and so on no consequenses there
also never scare a npc or a kid they make your ears bleed with same scream nearly on every npc for the womans scream as an example it really sounds like the same voice actor on all of the womans who are not part of the story even with the kids when they yell it sounds like this arrrh iggghhhh arrrrrghhhharrrh iggghhhh arrrrrghhhh rinse and repeat with no delay between the sounds of the screams
also a noteable mention is selecting objects like fire candles or even a bag to loot it is a nightmare to select objects with the camera in first personwouldnt had been a problem but it can also be done good in third person
i had to pick an note up but there were people standing near the table which means that you can talk with them or rather they tell you something but by all means the way you speak with them is the same freaking key you use to interact with ofcouse it would be the same but i had to get the perfect angle on the camera it took some time but it did not end there i had issues with that exact problem in many other places
the combat was also a bit meh
also not to mention micro stuttering when moving the mouse other posts i read that it goes back towhere the game was released where the issue also present feels like a console game because zero issues on a controller ondifferent machines
heres some links that confirms that issue and is still present
game is marked as a open world rpg story rich game and masterpiece according to steam in the tags
the game after my own opinion dosent have the rpgroleplayinggame elements as stealing something with no consequenses game is also marked as atmospheric well not with these screaming npcs with onlysounds on them
marked as a masterpiece it has issues that is game breaking for me when using the mouse and keyboard is a no go controller is needed for a smooth experience selecting objects is a nightmare
all this i mentioned so far i have not yet found any reviews writing about this so far game is a true masterpiece well it has some issues that is present
after all it is based on my opinion yours may be different on how you look at it a review is based on emotions"
"i have never played a game this good graphic design is fantastic this masterpiece of a game is gorgeous story is intersting catchy unpredictable and after few hours you will find yourself over head and ears in the plot as it continues and thickens gameplaywise the game is smooth as a butter with a few sweet sprinkles on top of it and entertaining however after you have mastered the combat even on the hardest difficulty this game is like a walk in the park after abouthours it is easy although with occasional challenges if i were to rate this art id rate it beyond skyrim and all other stuff personally this is the game and there is also books cardgame and tv series"
"great game
great graphics with enjoyable exploration supported with great soundtrack and impressive sound design
the plot for mainside quest is good very enjoyable especially the side content it makes the world feel alive with small details thrown herethere
the core combat gameplay is a bit dry though some actionmovement is abit too stiff
overall the game is really enjoyable lots of place to explore lots of story to uncover definitely worth my timemoney"
"great gameplay and story line"
"poor movement on foot and on horse lackluster combat unoptimized hud ungratifying loot rewards the hardest difficulty isnt difficult but instead forces you to learn how to cheese the alreadyclunky mechanics and the sex scenes are mostly vapid but the story is otherwise great"

"best game of the decade"
"witcheris a game that lets you be whoever you choose your decisions actually have a huge impact on the story results of your very own choices are not for a few different dialogues in fact your choices create a new atmosphere of relationships between many various characters
the story is absolutely phenomenal and it is also where the game shines at most sure the environment is good but there is no chance its perfect bugs are unfortunately unavoidable with animation errors and bugs i dont see the world worth to be immediately fully explored repetitive undiscovered tasks are swarmed in almost every location imaginable therefore it is not necessary to explore the world before taking quests take your quest first and explore the world for the undiscovered tasks then that way you can actually have fun and complete your quests at the same time
at first i didnt like it to me it felt like every open world game that is doomed with its repetitive combat system and missions however as soon as i start investing more hours into the game i got immediately hooked on by its adventurous story i wanted to know what happens next i wanted to know how my relationship with other characters evolves game does that well hence why i couldnt stop playing the game for a whole week
for the combat system to be fun you need to study your enemies investigate their weaknesses then apply specific oils to your sword use various bombs or simply abuse attackdodge technique but using that technique you will get nothing but a damage sponge match
try to overcome the games first experience as i know it is not the strongest perk of the game after some hours you will most likely be addicted to the game and will not make a single step out of your room"
"buy it now this is the best rpg i have played really great story i like the combat the voice acting is awesome and the soundtrack is my favorite game soundtrack well worth the price"
"great game i like singleplayer games and this one is the best after the first playtrought i am going to play both dlc and after that play new game this is a game with many possibilities and you can play the game in many different ways"
"the best rpg game ive ever played
a simple yet versatile and powerful control systemallowing you to personalise your combat style
a story so well written and with so many parallel stories that it is like watching a beautiful fantasy moviebut more like games of thrones than the classic one
just one big drawback at a certain point you finish the gameand there is nothing else like it"
"its ok i guess"
"i finally got a chance to play the witcherand i must say it lives up to the hypethis game does a fantastic job at pulling you into the world and giving you reasons to keep exploring it the game does a great job of taking you on an epic adventure throughout the main storythe lore the characters and towns all flesh out the journey in way that few other games have
as someone who has not played through the witchernor the witcheri feel like the games story works well on its own you play as geralt of rivia a witcher a witcher is basically a group of humans that undergo mutations through potions and most see them as mutants they were created for combat and they take out monsters throughout the land for money usually they are a dying breed because they stopped creating more because the whole process of creating them was completely unethical
the story starts with geralt as he is looking for yennifer a sorceress he has known for a long time it develops quickly from there and takes you down a winding path filled with all sorts of humans dwarfs elves and monsters without spoiling anything i absolutely loved the ending to this gamethere are multiple endings as well there is a specific relationship geralt builds throughout the game and i think it really makes the ending that i got great
i would be remiss if i didnt bring up gwent gwent is the in universe card game and at first i didnt want to get into it but i decided to do a quest related to it and next thing you know i spent a handful of hours playing everyone that would play me to build a good deck to give the very basics you getcards you play cards on the board for points you need the most points inout of therounds to win simple concept but even with a good deck there are no guarantees
the combat in the game is more than that of a simple hack and slash if you try to play this like dynasty warriors you will die quickly to basic monsters early on you need to be blocking parrying andor dodging enemies to survive you also have some handy tools that make fights much easier you can use some basic magic potions that heal or boost damage and oils that can boost damage preparing for the specific enemies at hand can make life much easier but i did find that i could make it through battles without preparation on the normal difficulty
i did not get a chance to play the dlc fully yet but the parts i have played have been really good so far also you can get some really good gwent cards with it so dont miss out on those
overall everyone who said this game was great back when it came out inwere right i am glad i finally got a chance to play through it and consider it to be one of the best games i have played to date if this type of game interests you at all i encourage you to take some time and play the witcher"

plotwise many times the quest conversation lines make no sense possibly because i take tour and clear question marks along the journey mostly ahead of the questprobably it should think about handling nonlinear game progress in a better way
in all its a down vote for its overrated nature should admit that its still a decent game with lots of content"

"i don feel that it an exaggeration to say the witcheris one of the best rpgs ever created it clear from playing it how much love cdpr poured into this project w boasts an absolutely overwhelming amount of content that maintains a refreshingly high average level of quality
one aspect of w i particularly enjoyed was how many morally grey decisions there were to make the world in this series is not black and white sometimes being a hero makes things worse in the end sometimes a monster deserves death even if it meant no harm sometimes you have to decide what the lesser evil is decisions in w constantly kept me thinking and rationalizing my actions
with an incredibly lovable cast of characters an intriguing storyline that your decisions affect an amazing soundtrack stunning visuals fun and complex gameplay i never tired of the witcherthroughout its entire multihundred hour tenure i wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy as i think almost anyone can find something to love in the rich world provided
i should also say that the expansions for witcherfeel like just that expansions the witcherby itself is absolutely a complete game and they are not essential they are however undeniably worth it hearts of stone is a smaller expansion with a story that i would say is the best quest line in the game blood and wine is massive and easily addshours to the game at least the game of the year edition is worth the small amount of extra money you pay
note that potential new players should recognize that this is the rd game in a series that is also preceded by several books while witchercan be played standalone and understood just fine i do recommend familiarizing yourself with the world by reading some summaries of at least witcherandbeforehand so you won feel so lost immediately upon starting the game oftentimes geralt and his companions reminisce on past events that have happened that a completely new player wouldn understand
ps if you buy it be careful about playing gwent you might get sucked into playing a deceptively addicting card minigame forhours in which case witchertakes a hard change and becomes a pokmon game in which you are maddeningly dedicated to finding every card you can to boost your deck and win every tournament in the land just a warning"

"literally cant rave about this game enough
play the damned side quests theyre worthwhile and often absolutely outlandish with all the absurdities of the world and strange people from villages turned to pigs to fighting off looters for friendly neighborhood prostitutes theres plenty to dolet alone the main story worth the playthrough
its been outyears why the hell havent you played this yet"
"without a doubt one of the best games ever made even tho it can be a buggy glitchy mess at times i still enjoyed every hour i played if a side quest is better than many many main quests in other games then you know the developers are definetly one if not the best out there if it comes to this i didnt play any previous witcher games and neither did i read any of the books about the universe but i think the world building is absolutely amazing the characters are often not at all one sided and you yourself have to choose many diffcult decisions
the first time i played this game aboutyears ago i didnt enjoy it simply because i wasnt able to step into this world and take it all in however i recently decided to give it another try and i didnt regret it withhours in my current playthrough i know there is a lot more to come and i know that i will have fun with the game till the last second
to round it up if some bugs and glitches here and there dont annoy you too much and if you like rpg games then why dont you already have this gamethe developers are one of the few that are trustworthy and i am hyped for cyberpunkbut until its released i will make sure to finish this masterpiece this game is simply breathtaking"

"this game is definitely one of my favorite gaming experiences ive ever had after picking it up and putting it down for well over a year i finally got hooked and would definitely put it near the top of my goat list
that being said and in fairness ill list the pros and cons of this game
cons
 the combat levelling and alchemy systems feel a bit clunky and overwhelming when you first begin the game and as a result can make getting into it a bit difficult
 the mapping system is a bit wonky at times and can glitch out and not lead you in the best direction
 the horse is probably the most overtly terrible part about this game numerous animation glitches that trigger fairly easily an unintuitive summoning system that can result in the horse spawning in inaccessible locations being unable to get to you do to the horse ai being unable to navigate tight terrain on its own and a rather janky feeling riding system that is a bit too sensitive some of those issues might be with my controller in fairness
 animations can at times look a bit janky especially facial animations and i haven encountered a few renderingcutting issues in cutscenes but overall its not too bad
pros
 the game is just stunning this is easily one of the prettiest games i have ever played
 combat and systems once you understand the combat crafting and alchemy systems of the game they feel veery satisfying
 the story of this game is very well written and the choices you make in game feel impactful not only for the ending but for the world around you
 the map is enormous and has loads of things on the side for you to explore
 the witcher contracts are some of the most fun quests in the game really puts you in the shoes of the title of witcher as opposed to just telling you you hunt monsters for coin and never actually letting you do so
all in all i highly recommend this game its huge its amazing ive puthours into it and im not even close to done with it"

"this game is nothing but incredible
backyears ago my brother told me that this new game called the witcherwas coming out me being the stupid idiot i am i just said oh cool and did nothing more with the information i had required
until the netflix witcher series came out
from that moment i knew what i must do i bought the game during the winter sales forand its the bestive spent in my life
this game captures it all the wonder and awe of exploring the highest peaks and the deepest oceans the fear of being chased by something you know can cut you down with ease the happiness of conquering said beast the enchantment of participating in the witcher trade and hunting down the nearest monster or bandit camp but most importantly this game captures the essence of family and the never ending impossibly irreplaceable love that binds people together
i came into this game with the highest of expectations and not once was i dissapointed time and time again this game excelled and excelled setting the bar higher and higher for the next quest or fight and every time it met that bar and smashed it to smitherines

at points i found bugs or slight texture problems but nothing critical or nothing gamebreaking the only time i needed to force restart the game my character of geralt simply froze in combat and could not and would not move and upon dying the game continued on as if i was alive
this game honestly has it all and if you reader are considering buying this game and giving it a whirl i can only suggest it with the highest recommendation i can possibly give
absolutely incredible a must play for anyone with hands andhours to sink"

"an amazing game i have been hooked from the start i hope there are more games like this"
"ive never played a game with such boring dialogue options as this there are absolutley no moral conflicts the player will face the game basically presents you the right option on a silver tablet leaving no room for other more complicated options that for example seem cruel but could be ultimatley good for the worldplayerfriendsetc
geralts moral code makes every decision an illusion because it holds him back doing evil things i know that his moral code is part of his character but why do they even bother with decisions then its not like we dont know that he follows this code
edit the gameplay is quite good but thats it unfortunately"
"recommended if you want a good story and fleshed out characters
if you enjoy good mechanics and gameplay this might not be your cup of tea
even inamazing visuals with the help of a few mods"

"witcher racing game when"
"good"
"no matter how unengaged into the story you might be at first there will be a certain point where you get really bound to the characters for me it was at the end of the novigrad part of main storyline but what mattered even more is that i didnt get there in the fastest way possible
you really must give a chance to all aspects of the game some might seem obsolete at first like oils potions and alchemy in general but within time you realise that in certain situations those can actually help you a lot
as opposed to skyrim loot doesnt have a stationary armordamage rating but instead goes along with your level soof the stuff you find will be either better than what you currently have or just a small bit worse unless its a really really common enemy drop such as bandits but in chests and while exploring the situation is guaranteed this leads to the fact that you actually feel glad that you found new loot while in skyrim you were technically able to get near top tier loot very early if you knew the proper locations which made the rest of the looting in game often unneccessary or boring
one thing ive seen people mention with this comparison is the fact that they feel like theyre watching a movie rather than being the character this is debatable and again id say it comes mostly from the fact that you didnt go deep enough into the story skyrim gives you the chances to be on top of almost every faction guild brotherhood and all such things in the game it makes you feel almightly this game despite being a fantasy keeps you down on earth you know your limits but you also know how versatile of a character you can be being bound to multiple character throughout the whole continent
storyline might be a bit confusing at first but with time you really get a hang of it
but i do plan on doing that when i get my fill in this game which is still far far away
one thing i recommend is to instantly turn on
 being overleveled occurs rather early in the game at around levelor so so i recommend that you turn this on as it just makes sure that enemies dont die in a single hit late game so that you get used to it not turning it on and wanting to do so late game will most likely result in you reverting the setting back and trust me being overleveled is much much more boring than facing a deaththreatening enemy with starter gear"
"only the best game ever"
"good"
"this game is objectively one of the best games ive ever played its been a long time since ive immersed myself into such a lore driven game many choices many quests multiple explorations and you may take as long or short on the game as you want even though the main game is amazing for the best ending finish the game with blood and wine an excellent way to end such an incredible saga"

"open and fascinating world great main story side quests are good and you can go back and revisit them wherever they are to see the consequences of a decision or sometimes see them again randomly pop up later in the story which makes the time you took completing it seem more worthwhile and interconnected to the rest of the game great graphicsfun combatgood levelingawesome storydont be afraid to use wiki or youtube reviews from the first two games to play catch up on story elements you dont understand just naturally try to avoid spoilersi came into w having only seen and loved the netflix tv show
final thoughttake it for what it is and dont try to beat it in a weekend speed runyoull be miserable because there is so much to do if you have gotten to the point where you are blasting through cut scenes with dialogue and not reading or listening at all to the story then take a break for the daytake it in chunks and youll find yourself being happier to come back to play ithours and i still havent beaten the main story but its been so fulfilling"
"i have had this game in mylibrary for years finally though i have played through the main quest so i will say with out understanding the back story i had a hard time getting into it so yes just like so many others i watched the series on netflix now i understand the story of this game doesnt directly connect to the story of the books or now series on netflix after having watched the show though i kinda had more of an understanding of the world more of an understanding of a witcher well i sunk into this game and deep im still playing and still loving this game i dont even know if ill be able to explain why this game is such a masterpiece to me first things first for me this game feels more alive than probablyof any other game ive played the movement of the trees in the wind the dynamic weather the chit chat going on in cities the game for beingyears old has aged magnificently so far it has more to do thanprobably anything else ive ever played i dont want to spoil anything for anybody just know if you did watch the series and are curious if this is worth a try i would say absolutely yes if you give this game a chance you will thank yourself im half temped once i finish the dlc to try a new gameand do everything the opposite of the way i did the first go and see how that turns out"

"hmmm fck what to say about this incredible game that hasnt already been said
once you get used to the combat mechanics and the early difficult especially when playing on death march difficulty this game is one of the most immersive detailed and plotdriven rpg games out there the dlc alone adds an whopping amount of extra quests areas and abilities if youve not yet played this game you are missing out"

"maybe a round of gwenteh"
"the witcherwas clearly a labour of love it is the culmination of an excellent series of games and thankfully the creators have let it remain as is a perfect masterpiece with no need for more dlc beyond the first two which you should pick up and no planned sequel it is an rpg where you play a well realized and deep character rather than one of your own creation and it should be praised for that"

"there are no words worthy of this game if you have not tried it yet i envy you now do the only right thing and start your adventure"
"i waited untilto buy this game but with the tv series coming out and a deep discount on the goty edition i thought id finally take the plunge and see what all the fuss is about
so its a great immersive world absolutely stunning terrain and weather effects and a vast land to poke around however i wish i was doing something so so different or more interesting in the actual world the combat is pretty dull and repetitive besides a few set piece monster fights ive seen so far controls are a bit janky and every room feels cramped while every cave seems way way too dark i didnt really get pulled into the admittedly standardboring seeming story but im not much for listen to characters talk in third person view while you makeofbarely different choices the open world was soby the book too i was hoping theyd change the formula but it was the same tired map icon collecting and repeated events andconcepts also merchants with limited gold and being showered with constant meaningless loot is really tedious especially when you spendof your time holding witcher senses down to see every last minutiae of junk
i never came home from work thrilled and anxious to play this game it was a bit of a chore and i had to reason with myself why it would be worth it to grind through the creeping sense of boredom the game clearly wasnt a good fit for me but seems to be a smash success for literally hundreds of thousands of people so who knows
overall a sad let down i was hoping to get utterly hooked and play hours and hours but alas maybe ill try again and just start with one of the dlcs"
"i adore this game it makes me sad but in a good way just play it"
"great game very imaginative"
"this game is life changing youll either hate it or it will become your new favorite thing beautiful graphics even bystandards hundreds of hours worth of content incredible soundtrack and a fantastic story this is one of precious few games in recent memory that has true expansions blood and wine is a must have its basically a whole separate game on top of the main story
this game will throw you right in so if youre not at all familiar with the witcher the netflix show is an excellent introduction to the characters and world in fact thats how i got into the game in the first place i can safely say this is my new favorite game and franchise ive even started reading the books the only thing i regret is not playing it sooner a must have experience"

"i know im late to the party but this game cant get enough praise
my internet connection died a few months ago and so i thought hey theres this game installed in my library everyone loves but i had never looked into
so i started playing the witcherandcompletely forgot to fix my internet connection because this game is a masterpiece a milestone among singleplayer rpgs and has fantastic dlcs which could be standalone games
 would loose internet connection again"
"this is easily still one of the best rpg games you can play these days im not saying its perfect oh no it has its flaws and things that could have been done a little better what im saying is that when you play it it definitely feels perfect huge world filled with life so many quests with interesting stories grabbing main storyline with a whole cast of memorable characters feeling of discovery and wonder as you progress deeper and deeper into the game and encounter new monsters find new loot and solve new mysteries add an unmistakable slavic atmosphere into the mix and thats the witcherright here ready for you to play it and loose yourself in its world be prepared to spend at least a hundred hours of your time though as there is an insane amount of content"
"hopefully next gen games are as good as this"
"sexy hot girls"
"yes"
"good story"
"didnt play it"
"tldr the hype around the game is justified its a great game all around
there is probably not much to be said about tw that hasnt already been said at this point but i wanted to add that its still and probably will be for a long time worth playing even if youve no idea about its lore or the previous games
the story is probably the main selling point for the game its very fleshed out and the characters well written the world also helps bring it to life with myriads of side quests and stories that dont feel repetitive or templated the gameplay feels fluid and satisfying especially in higher difficulty levels the graphics are beautiful and even when they become dated youll still occasionally find yourself just admiring the view from a high place
overall i would recommend this game to anyone wanting an enjoyable rpg experience without grinding or tacticheavy combat just to sit back and have fun in a vast and adventurefilled world"

the modding is even easy to install which allows for even greater functionality
like even the expansions are amazing bloodwine could be its owngame and i would still love it cd project red i cant wait for cyberpunk the time setting is not my favorite but i know it will be close to the wticherin quality game design and lack of bugs thank you"

"pretty terrible game really got to the part where i needed to go to crookbag bog and there were no markers or signs of where it was either my game was broken or i was supposed to search across the entire map until i fell across itended up googling where it was which made me feel like i was cheating deleted the game and doubt i will play again"
"yesssss"
"yes"
"yes"
"theres nothing i can say that hasnt already been said many times over their really is that much to do the game is designed to let you play the way you want and rewards you for taking care of the secondaryside quests witcher contracts and treasure hunts more than any game i can remember playing it is also the fist game to create a game within the game that i actually really love gwent is fun quick and adds something worthwhile"

"where most characters kneel geralt of rivia squats like a true slav
i like to play using the polish audio with subtitles why well why do
watch anime with japanese audio and subtitles yeah thats what i thought
oh and the game is pretty great too i guess plays like a dream tells a great story that i didnt personally need to have played its predecessors to understand and there are dwarves in it"
"so after many years of owning the game and having to replay the game i have finally finished the gamethe honest truth is the developers know how to make a very engaging story with choices that truly matter i definitely strongly suggest not fully completing all themarks you see just take your time with them the quests and main story are where the meat of the game exists that was the sole reason why it took me so long to come back to this game to complete it at first it tookhours for my first playthrough so for my second playthroughit has taken me abouthours to complete there is so much story involved the plot was excellent and when you figure things out for yourself it makes it all the worth i highly suggest playing the game atleast for the story remember choices do matter here if you are ok with morally grey situations and real life outcomes then i highly suggest this"
"this game is insane
its been yonks since its release but it still hold true to a true open world experience
i love this in game"

sure i played a lot of games in the years a lot of good games a few fantastic ones but i always had a place in my heart for the one game i loved above all other
now im not so sure anymore
this game is so good it retroactively shattered my childhood memories"
"yeah it has really good story decent combat if you dont like story heavy games and just want some hack and slash then this is not it it can go pretty long between fights sometimes but it pretty darn worth it if you like rpgs biggest pro or con depending on who you are is that if you lets say decide in a side mission that you want to kill the mice that steal the cheese at the start of the game then you might meet the mice brother at the end of the game and because you have killed his brother he will get revenge on you instead of helping you not a real scenario just pointing out that your choices is affecting the story"

the graphic is still beautiful inwith wide array of setting available although i had some trouble with alt tabbing in and out and frequently glitch the fullscreen
gameplay wise its tricky
the core mechanic the witcher sense is quite annoying to use and can be somewhat disorienting and tiring to use i strongly recomend turning the minimap hud to show the witcher sense just so you wont get stuck while looking for tracks the whole mechanic is iffy and could be better implemented even without the fish eye effect you need to hold a button to maintain witcher sense sometimes it slows you to walking pace the tracks often very hard to see and it lacks colorblind options all that complaint combined with how almost all quest and sidequest strongly rely on this gimmick makes this long game somewhat a chore not to mention the combat
the combat and skill tree is really shallow the skill tree looks like it allows player to choose their way to play but by the end of the day everyone should invest a lot on the blade skills with every other skill tree optional at best you can choose to play alchemy throw bombs drink potions oil your blades and fight forminutes or just go for blade and swingtimes to kill a miniboss
the combat is interesting but it lacks progression and is very repetitive throughout the game you gain almost all your signs oils potions and bombs early on with few unlocks as you play then slowly the oils feels less important signs is strictly optional and the same dodge and swing from start to finish
all in all the gameplay feels lacking is merely because its accompanied with stellar story which sets my expectation a bit too high
the gameplay serves its purpose as for the rest i have nothing but praises"
"definitely will play again"
"made with love played with love"
"so much things to do and keep you occupied lots of stuff to learn if you like skyrim youre gonna like this game as well i like that my choices in game impact the world this is the first game i played that is like that after fableand fable iii"
"best rpg game eveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer"
"good game so far movement kind of clunky though"
"great game with the richest world ive seen in rpgs that feels real even the fantasy parts somehow feel realistic
the combat is interesting and progressive
each swing feels like there is weight behind it and the animations of the monsters attacks seem real and make sense as if they studied real griffins to animate
the characters and the story are interesting and nothing feels forced everything feels very much like someone just wrote a biography about interesting and awesome tales"
"sexy game"
"witcherwild hunt is arpg developed and published by cd projekt red and based on the witcher series of fantasy novel by andrzej sapkowski
up for a round of gwent
anyway game really worth it i really recommend buying the game of the year edition since it has all the expansion packs and quite cheaper than buying them all individually"
"good and keeps me busy from life"
"this game is really good and its really fun to play because it has a nice story and gameplay but downsides to this game is that it can be quite boring sometimes but who am i to say i havent even played the whole game"
"a true game of the decade you are missing out if you havent played this"
"this is the oldest game in my desk for all time"
"pro
great story
open world
quest with consequences in the future

some bugs when you can get stuck cant take action and such
pretty easy even in max difficulty"
"not sure what is left to say about the witcherthat hasnt been said already great game that works great on ubuntu under proton"
"best horse"
"such an amazing time youll have playing this game released inbut still better than most recent single player story games"
"i just love this game spend overhours in this game and will probably spend even more just buy it"
"greatest horse physics of all time"
"do i really gotta explain anything the game is ing awesome if you dont like it youre wrong and a communist and you probably have a foot fetish"
"i played this game on the ps and hated it originally because of the controls however on pc i absolutely loved it after i got a feel for the controls i never finished the game on the ps but after a thoroughhours on pc for the the first play through i think i can say i definitely enjoyed this game the dlc is definitely worth having as well now on to completing the dlc and ng"
"if after all these years youre still looking at reviews for the witcherthen youre an idiot buy the game already"
"amazing game with an incredible storyline great graphics and awesome dialogue although my sound is wierd but over all an amazing game"
"fantastic game from start to finish imhours in and there are easily hundreds of hours left of things to do amazing story the voice acting is top notch and the characters are so easy to fall in love with i didnt expect to fall for this game as hard and fast as i did but im so glad i picked it up when i did for a game thats overyears old the graphics are incredible if someone told me this was made a year ago id believe them do yourself a favor and pick up a copy you wont be disappointed"
"best immersive rpg out there for its time and now in modern day well recommended and should be played more then once"
"great game"
"i just love it"
"it just takes over i have other games i love to play but for some reason i developed muscle memory to start this game when i boot up the computer i could do it blindfolded"
"deserving of the title greatest rpg ever made fun combat with a lot of depth given that many of the enemies are best suited to specific tactics incredibly well executed quests and stories that will stick with you for a long time i recently started my second playthrough after having completed the first one when the game came outyears ago and im finding that i still remember most of it as it just made such a strong impact on me ive read the books played allgames and now watched the netflix show and goddamn do i love this world this game is incredible and im really looking forward to playing the dlc which i never got around to if you havent played it yet youre honestly depriving yourself of an experience not just a game this is one of those games that defines what gaming is for a lot of peopleits the kind youll look back on fondly and remember as one of the experiences that made you really love gaming do yourself a favor and play it
the one criticism i see people bring up that has any merit is that they think its boring while i dont feel that way at all since im a huge fan of the world and lore i can see how people might be put off by the extreme amount of conversations and cut scenes i find this to enhance the game but some will find it to be the opposite for them if youre someone who enjoys reading recreationally youll probably really appreciate the stories and conversations if youre looking for a game more focused on action and fastpaced leveling you may find the pace is not to your liking"
"witty hippity dippity hmm"
"the best"
"plenty of other reviews here already stating why i would recommend the game so i will keep this short

 from me
in case youre interested in a slightly more info
only thing i would advice against is going into the game completely blind if you are thinking of getting into the game due to the hype you might end up feeling the game is over hyped have a look on youtube or the wiki and see if the story lore and characters interest you the beginning of the game can feel a bit boring so try to mix it up with doing side quests and exploring the map
combat also seems to be a deal breaker for some people its up to the player to make it interesting you can choose to just spam right click and dodge here and there until the enemies are eventually defeated or mix up your combat with signs bombs bows and so on the bestiary helps a lot in harder difficulties
thats about it from me thanks for reading"
"goodness gracious this game was released inhere i am playing inand i gotta say boy overwhelming indeed the story is great i regretted a few decisions which i now cannot take back but is a good excuse to revisit once i finish this one geralt is handsome as heck im obsessed graphic is fantastic geralt approves he says mhmm with a smile"

there is an endless amount of things for you to do it has aged very well over the pastyears still has beautiful graphics i still will sometimes sit there and watch the gorgeous scenes of kaer morhen amazing story which made me shed a tear at leasttimes while playing details that shows the love the creators gave to this masterpiece and an overall satisfaction that makes me wish more game developers give this amount of depth and care to their products a decent amount of people use this game to compare all other games too
its on sale all the time and for the price your getting something that will easily entertain for overhours
good luck on the path"

"ah the mighty witcher 
the unbeatable unshameable candonothingwrong witcheryou know what its about in general you know what many people think about it but im not one of those people read on if you want to read a differing opinion avoid reading if youre one of the many who pray every night to a shrine of various witcherparaphernalia
its a fine game i give the story an a i give the sound and voice acting an a i give the visuals a b i give the presentation ui and ui manipulation a b i give the optimization an a i give the level of polish a c and i give the controls an f yes an f an f as in the lowest grade an f for failure
i cant express just how much i despise getting around in this game geralt moves around like an angry pound guy being propelled by hurricaneforce winds thats how it feels when you push forward on the analog stick he starts off at a walk but very soon after he breaks into an awkward janky closedfist quick jog and that awkward movement is to be your primary method of getting around
thankfully the developers made him switch automatically to a walk whenever you enter houses et al but the moment you emerge into the outdoors again youre at the mercy of that janky run turning corners while running forget it geralt only makes ultra wide turns like a lumbering wheeler turning off the highway without having applied the breaks when they shouldve been applied my god guys
i know i know what youre thinking the game has so much to offer why not focus on that why make your review about this ill tell you why because the crappy controls prevent me from enjoying all the content to the fullest look im not asking for miyazakiquality animation here all i need is a smooth walktorun transition that amounts to perhaps three different walking animations of increasing speed before the run begins thats nothing to say of the run itself desperately lacking any indication that geralt is an athlete of any kind ugh
ive gone back and forth from xbox one elite controller to steam controller to keyboard and mouse and ive decided to settle on km because the animations are just garbage so i may as well just jankrun everywhere and keep the walk function bound on my mmo mouse for easy access in case i need to slow his big dumb self down to turn a corner or stop in front of an npc to talk to them without bodychecking them first
and the thing is i know cdpr can do better they have the talent dont they if they didnt then they should have it now what with the gobs of money theyve made since the games release
and why not revisit the game why end support of it is this not your pride and joy bugs are everywhere i was just in a tavern where some guys were watching an empty stage hooting and hollering and making lewd noises only to discover that the strumpet they were pretending to watch was doing her little strumpet dance by the tavern door where i came in seriously
should i even mention the random townsfolk sitting in midair in various locations its no wonder theyre weeping id weep too if i was anchored to the air no matter what i did and as a cherry on top every time you die in battle theres a delay and then geralts corpse does this gravitydefying hop into the air before being thrown across the terrain as though he were suddenly the victim of a driveby poltergeist
guys other games have been blasted to pieces in reviews for less bugs than the witcherhas theyve been laughed at spit at made the butt of every joke meme you can think of mass effect andromeda never gave me so many problems inb i agreed with you until you supported mea yeah oh well ill say it ill risk being slammed by gamer mob mentality mass effect andromeda was and is in a better state than the witcher 
my god its just so unpolished its so unpolished that i actually fear for the release state of cyberpunkso i wont be purchasing that one on release day ill wait to watch some gameplay first and for a patch or two to drop
do i recommend the game ultimately yes why after all that after my annoyances because the story is fantastic and its long anything that wellconceived and long can be weathered in spite of the lack of polish i can do it doesnt mean ill enjoy the ride to the utmost degree
ps yes i only havehours here but i have overon gog which is where you should have bought the game if you wanted to support cdpr to the best of your ability
thanks for reading"

"i have completed my quest to go through all the witcher games and i must say what a way to end this is the best game ever made all the clunk of the witcheris fixed the combat becoming more fluid and i really felt in control of geralt as i slashed my way through monster after monster like the other two even though this time the combat is actually good the story is the main shine of this game and what a story it is i have never felt so many emotions in a video game this game truly brought me to tears at times fans of the books will appreciate how certain wrongs were finally made right and how now you can finish this story play this game you absolutely must id recommend playing all three but you dont have to this is the best game ever made and it deserves all the praise it has attained over the years
ps cant forget gwent in the game it is very flawed but if it isnt really ing fun i got every card and i dont regret it play gwent"

"the crafting is intuitive and the open world is amazing while it does pose the disadvantage to going somewhere too soon i feel like if youre as prepared as a witcher would be youd be able to get out of there always a fun game to return to"
"this game is awesome in every sense of the word once you get on the back of your horse and travel across the land youll more than often gasp at the beauty of your surroundings so many detailsyou move past a field of wheat and what do you know it actually moves in the wind thats a level of detail which is easy to miss but once you spot it it also really adds up
the story itself is easy to get into even if you havent played any earlier titles and are completely new to the franchise
finally the controls there are many to learn and to get familiar with but fortunately the tutorial can help you get up to speed quickly enough and theres always the ingame glossary which you can use to read up on things such as the tutorial
so far so good its obvious that a lot of attention has been put to detail and its noticeable the atmosphere of the game isalso plain out astonishing
butthere are so many nice details to this game that the things which dont go right or which dont make much sense easily stand out and thats a shame
for examplein the beginning you come across an inn keeper whos very grateful that you saved their kin and so they tell you 
 great but if you then ask them what they got to offer you youll enter a shopping dialog and suddenly have to pay for bread and other supplies whatever happened to my free meal
youre a witcher a warrior who can wield magic and who knows how to stand up against the occult monsters demons etc to this end you also carryswords a regular one and one made out of silver which is more effective against those monsters however because of all this witchers arent exactly loved by the people most will distrust you because of all the unnatural things you can do and you can do a lot fighting magic brewing potions
yet out of everything you can do you cant manage to repair your own gear once your sword starts giving out which unfortunately seems to happen rather quickly then youll need a craftsman to fix it really you can improve on your weapons but you lack the skills to repair them yourselves given the dislike and distrust amongst the people regarding the witchers this made absolutely no sense to me surely such an order would try their best not having to rely too much on those who generally mistrust you
and finally the tutorial explains a lot but not everything during your first real quest youll get a crossbow and its suggested to use it in order to prevent your prey from escapingif only the game would have also told you how to actually use it thatd help but it doesnt even the tutorial only mentions your swords and how to exchange between them yet it ignores the crossbow completely eventually i discovered a mention of the crossbow in the spell selection screen which also madesense to me but after i selected it i still couldnt fire the regular button youd use to cast spells kept casting those even though i had selected something completely different
eventually i found out by reading the comment section of a wiki this mentioned the middle mouse key but its still a bit sloppy to say the least
the atmosphere of this game is awesome and the game itself does a lot of things right if youre into rpgs which are set in a medieval fantasy environment then prepare to get sucked right into it the story feels fresh is easy to follow and plain out intriguing
there will be a few issues which may not make sense or which may come across as annoying at first but honestly those are also easy to ignore i definitely recommend this game"
"what more can be said about this game that hasnt been said a thousand times already
youve heard how great the game is thats why youre looking at reviews are you looking for someone to tell you otherwise it wont happen just do yourself a favor and purchase it
ive put as much time as i have into this game because its the only game that truly makes me feel immersed in another world the characters the atmosphere the musicevery second i play this game im not just your average firstname lastname living on the planet earth im geralt of rivia butcher of blaviken witcher living on the continent
theres no other experience like this you wont be disappointed"

"one this game is immersive and that is a big part of its charm for me you can quest in the first zone for hours without ever having solved the main questof all the witcher games i have loved this one the most but that is not to say i didnt not like the first two the game however feeds my ocds i have pick the plants on the map so much so that i have to turn off the notifiers so i dont spend the nexthours picking blowballs and false parley until crash head first into my keyboard the quests require a bit of soul searching put coins in the purse or let the poor guy keeps his daughters measleycrowns dowrey there is humour galore a lot of of dry there is crafting skill trees that arent too obnoxious and plenty of times when if you dont brew the right potion and put the right oil on your blade its painfully obvious i find that pretty good for a game it makes you stick to the lore and not just overpower things i forget how to counterattack most days but at least i get the parries inthis is mykind of role playing game and im still playing it almost what five years after release heck i still play skyrim too this game is a keeper and i can keep coming back to it and feeling like im diving into something special i will also admit that being able to turn it on ultra and admiring the sights and sounds has a great appeal too"
"after playing through the main story and most of the side quests the witchernever got boring it remained very engaging and pure fun until the end amazing story and detail even in the side quests its easy to highly recommend this game to any rpgopen worldfantasy game fans it is as good as people tell you it is the best game in its genre that ive played by far"

as a side note looking forward to cyberpunk and the fact that they pushed the release back on thatone only need look at witcherto understand cdpr knows what they are doing and if they need more time by all means it will be worth the wait"

"best witch dating sim there is"
"pros decisions have an affect on the story just like real life there are a vast amount of quests and places to explore even a small side game gwent within the game the main story is decent too optional playing styles because of the use of signs versus a one dimensional melee style graphics are goodits only a one player which is fine since i am not into pvpfor being a scripted game its very good
cons my biggest complaint would be movementspecifically its a little too overboard with being realistic i know its tough to literally stop immediately after running but geralt sometimes goes a bit too far and it more of an issue when sliding down half of a mountain when it would be more realistic to grab onto something to stop a bigger issue is dealing with roach one picky horseeither its a glitch or just a clumsy designif you arent on a perfectly smooth path the horse is a pain to move at times reaction a bit slow
the only other thing i can think of is too many deaths from falling from relatively small heights i dont expect geralt to be assassins creed because a jump or slip fromshould typically end in death butfoot drop and you lose all your healthit would be more realistic to break a leg then use a mend potion which doesnt exist in the game meaning maybe it should jump downfeet break your leg geralt says dammit drink a mend potion then says thats better and keeps going"
"i think i dont need to say how good this is
its not a simple game anymore its pure art
there wont be a better video game experience than the witcherwild hunt
well maybe cyberpunkwill be to be honest i wont be mad if cyberpunk cant reach that level that the witcherhas
cd project red deserve all the love and support they are the last hope for all people who truly love video gaming"

here is the thing about the witcher
you have to play for the side quests also enjoy conversations if this isnt you i would recommend this game less for you"

"the open world single player rpg is back in full force here the choice you sometimes get between different outcomeseg who will become the next skelliger king is also a nice touch i miss in games gives it a personal touch that you may reflect on hoping some of the decisions make a lasting effect in the later game oh how i miss the mass effect choices
the game is a as solid as it could be with our without the dlc great value for money and can be a real investment of your time i was predicting the missionscontracts would be repepitive but i still love each one maybe the scariness from when your first start gets lost gradually but the atmosphere and the character and world building in this game are sublime"

"this game is like playing through a book and a movie at the same time its beautifully animated with amazing world environment the world you can explore is open sandbox and massive there is a ton to explore theres a lot of side quests and contracts but they dont feel like filler content some of the story can get quite emotional and you feel for the characters and their plights there are moments when you have to quickly make a choice than can come into play later on in the game so choices matter
theres also the ingame card game gwent its a lot of fun and if you want to put time into playing it challenge everyone you can from the get go you want to collect them all wink wink nudge
 if you like storyrich open world rpgs i think you will enjoy this game as well"

"amazing"
"one of the best games of the decade if youre thinking of buying it you already know how good it is"
"if you can plz explain to me how a convoluted shadow of mordor clone deserves more than athen go for it buddy i enjoy complex rpgs with complex elements to them the witcher is simply but a psuedo complex so called rpgthe witcher being a hack and slash a genre that deserves no praise what so ever this little number is nothing like skyrim skyrim being the creme de la creme of truly great rpgs some people have dismissed skyrim and i believe that is because they do not understand the complexity of genuinely complex games and that is a sad moment when people cannot recognize greatness"
"i am not a huge role playing game player in fact i only havehours of skyrim played total lol yet when i played the witcherwild hunt for the first time i was captured into its world and lost for over a hundred hours this games ability to tell the stories of the witcher universe is beautiful cd projekt red has done an extraordinary job of capturing the vision of the witchers author andrzej sapkowski they have made the series of the witcher novels a beautiful reality and thrilling world to live and experience in the stories characters monsters and even the world itself will capture you and keep you invested for its wild ride i wholly recommend this game for all especially those who arent rpg enthusiasts"

"do you love ignoring main quest
do you love having sex on stuffed animals
have you ever wanted to try on women clothes
if you answered yes to any of those questions this is the game for you
you play as geralt a mutant with cat eyes and hair as pale as your malnourished flesh that hasn seen sun in a week will be after finishing this game
story begins as geralt embarks on a journey to find love of his life but not before traveling through cities farms and slums taking on every monster contract in known world fist fighting everyone forcing all humans and nonhumans to a round of gwent
the game offers wellcrafted stories with choices that you make and which shape your journey you can become a monster who incites fear in everything living or not so or become saint gregory himself a paragon of virtue who picks daisies and helps to paint trolls fence
the worldit massive as massive as the hole in your heart when you finish the game hundreds of locations more npcs to talk to than real life each with their stories and quests to offernd some even more than that if you catch my meaning
gorgeous graphics and animations superb voice acting your jaw will drop more times than wind has howled each time you ride through city or see a mountain range immersion takes a hold of you and after some time youl never want to go outside again even the most mundane thing you do will feel as if orchestra is following your every step with three ladies yodeling about your every move
fighting will become a second nature to you using swords potions and signs to your advantage reading books about monsters learning how to slay beasts for money and not getting yourkilled in process is an experience only few games offer
witcheraged like a fine wine considering games that have come out in past couple of years this game will take a hold of you you will be satiatedreal life will seem bleak and boring while being at school or work only thing you will be thinking about ishow can i complete that contract and what armor should i wear for my next fight
this game deserves every praise and your money in full"

this is such a good experience geralt is a great character all wise and tough like an old jedi his world is beautiful and the buffet of monsters to hunt is large the writing is absolutely incredible the story somewhat less so but very worth it

"i am a female player who loves a good story and great game playthis game is the best combination of both i have ever seenthe open world is amazingly lovinglyalmost mindbogglingly detailedevery corner of every map has somethingthe empty marsh with a forgotten secret treasurethe unexpectedly beautiful vista after climbing a rise standing out in such a stark contrast to the warntorn countryside youve traveled through to get thereabandoned cabins which tell a story all of their ownthis is all the extrasplaces you do not have to visit its all just there waiting to be discovered
the quest design is brilliantgiven the complexity of trying to make a story in an open world where you could find things completely in the wrong order the designers are nearly flawless in the execution
most of all controlling geralt feels naturalmuch much better than witcheri am not a power gamer and yet i can easily crossbow an oncoming foe cast a quick sign for protection and draw my blade to attackthis is also the first game where riding a horse and piloting a small skiff works so well i dont mind doing it even when sometimes i could quick travelthere are some places that are just fun to gallop your horse throughor speed your boat through the waters
the scope of this game is just breathtakingthe story is dark and gritty so much so that you wonder if the world isnt so completely messed up that you should just let the bad guys winbut then there are those momentsand they are rare true but moments where you have a chance if you want to make a bit of hoperestore a villagesave a merchantbring a family back togetheryou cant change the worldkings will beand wars will be warsbut you can do your part to make it better one quest at a timethis is the part that seems most analogous to our everyday real liveswe cant stop politicians from beingor wars and violence from happening but we can do our part to make the world a little better place one day at a time"
"amazing game from top to bottom great story writing characters and gameplay theres some things that arent perfect but as a whole package the game is one of the greats not for everyone but still amazing sometimes the gameplay loop gets boring and you can really feel this in the open world exploring but i would say overall the witcheris a milestone in gaming"

"very good game"
"good"
"game of the decade"
"highly recommended"
"im one of those people whos had the game for years and just never got around to playing it oh how i regret not playing this gem till now because even comparing it to newer games i can truly say this game is probably already in my topgames of all time only reason its not topis because multiplayer games are more my cup of tea
the story and world is fleshed out raw mature kinky and gruesome with little to no room for improvement its good enough that you end up reading all the flavor text but youre not forced to closely read up on any of it to understand whats going on you could probably just open most readables once and the game will note down any important points you need later bringing it up when you need it
combat is hard and unforgiving if you dont stock up on healing items but a few skills can make healing items way to effective i mean food items lastmin who thought that sounded balanced
was hoping taking on certain types of monsters would require more preparation but at the same time im glad youre not totally boned if youre in combat with a ghost and didnt bring its weakness with you
music is spot on luxury to the ears though i did get enough of the combat theme after a while
leveling and gear is well thought out and can accommodate a wide range of playstyles light armor for highamounts of time spent combat rolling heavy armor if you cant be asked to dodge even to save your life and medium for people with decent dodging skills but still want to live if they mess up a dodge
gwentthe minigame for people who want a card collector game in their story rich roleplaying games
people are so rude and im loving it i think some of the npcs would just fall apart if they dont call someone or something the son of a woman of easy virtues every other sentence
highly recommend this title if you like dark and gritty rpgs but keep the unsee button ready cause some of the things in this game are worse then even the worst nightmare fuel i might just dig out my brain with a rusty spoon if i ever have a dream about thecrones of the forest if you know what i mean then you have my sympathies"
"this is one the the greatest rpgs of all time get on this train"
"pretty good game"
"one of the best games i have ever played"
"game is one of the better single player rpgs ive ever playedthey didnt half anything even the side quests come along with ministories
my only complaint would be nitpicking is the mount sometimes gave me a headache running into clutter and was clunky at times the camera sometimes could be a problem when the game went from dialogue to battle
those two things are a drop in the bucket compared to all the greatness the game had so def try it out hours and hours of content"

"its a really good game there is no doubt about that story level design graphics and sound quality is top notch my only complaint is the combat system i wish it was more responsive fluid and intuitive similar to assassins creed sleeping dogs or batman arkham series
the small fraction of the reviews are negative and most of them relates to this issue if your main source of entertainment comes from combat then it might be hard to get into in your first hours after a few hours the story grips you and at that point the game transforms into a high quality tv show with constant cliffhangers which keeps you hooked up until the end
i had that feeling almost in all witcher games because cd projekt red didnt innovate much in combat mechanics i hope they will overcome this in cyberpunk"
"playing the witcherwild hunt so far has been a wonderful journey of losing myself in the engaging story and sprawling world at first as someone who had not played the prior two games i was overwhelmed with both the complex story and game mechanics while confronted with countless avenues to take after a few days of playing i got the hang of things and eventually came to appreciate the beauty in the complexity and the joy of getting a handle on the mechanics whether it was figuring out how to effectively kill a monster with a specific play style or holding my own against multiple higher level enemies each discovery has been as rewarding as the last im just overhours in and i have so much story left to finish i highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a fantastical rpg openworld experience with a compelling story with slice of romance"

"evenyears later this game is an epic undertaking in storytelling and writing voice actors are almost all excellent it really pushes the engine to its limit in terms of the diversity of what all the character models and environmental assets are being asked to do as compared to how things must have looked for the first couple weeks of this game the tiny glitches that are still left are mostly graphical in naturecertainly not gamebreaking which is more than can be said of pretty much any other aaa game released since any grind is pretty much unnoticeable since theres something interesting for your character to do no matter your level mod support is excellent and the mod community is still active the controls eh at first i hated the way spells were cast and items were used however now i see that the game developers goal was to force players to strategically predict encounters with enemies and plan things out rather than relying on pure reflexes and spamming buttons to win the expansions are also badass great deal overalli spentbucks on the whole collection on a steam sale which i consider to be my best game purchase yet minor qualityoflife annoyances are all easily fixed with mods would highly highly recommend"

it is not without flaws of course but the flaws i found and experienced as i played through this game for nearlyhours is equivalent to sand between my toes while i enjoy my time at the beachits annoying to have them but it doesnt put a damper to everything else i experienced this game is time and money well spent truly revolutionary in a lot of aspects
some might say that god of war may be that game and i wouldnt blame them for it its just that to me the time i spent going in blind ive yet to read the books and i went into this game without having played the previous ones is definitely one of if not the most memorable moments of my life as someone who is a simple fan of video games

graced a ride along
with geralt of rivia
along came this song
when the white wolf fought
a silver tongued devil
his army of elves
at his hooves did they revel
they came after me
with masterful deceit
broke down my lute
and they kicked in my teeth
while the devils horns
minced our tender meat
and so cried the witcher
he cant be bleat
toss a coin to your witcher
oh valley of plenty
oh valley of plenty oh
toss a coin to your witcher
oh valley of plenty
at the edge of the world
fight the mighty horde
that bashes and breaks you
and bring you the morn oh
he thrust every elf
far back on the shelf
high up on the mountain
from whence it came
he wiped out your pest
got kicked in his chest
hes a friend of humanity
so give him the rest
thats my epic tale
our champion prevailed
defeated the villain
now pour him some ale
toss a coin to your witcher
oh valley of plenty
oh valley of plenty oh
toss a coin to your witcher
a friend of humanity
toss a coin to your witcher
oh valley of plenty
oh valley of plenty
toss a coin to your witcher
a friend of humanity

"this game is my favorite game ive ever played and one of the best games ever made every side quest is engaging there are no fetch quests the main story is very good the graphics hold up very well and it is an all round great game the amount of content you are getting foris absolutely insane i would recommend this game to anyone who has even the slightest interest in rpgs"
"one of the best rpgs i have ever played and a strong contender for first place thats coming from someone who regards rpgs as their favourite genre since the ps era and has played most aaa rpgs released since the s the combat is complex but smooth and satisfying once you master it i completed the game on death marchhardest difficults with relative ease once i got going not because it was easy but the game rewards you for playing well and smart by not getting hit and exploiting enemy weaknesses by using signsmagic potions and oils and good timing the graphics are fantastic the voice acting is fantastic the story is fantastic and aimed at a mature audience there is so much content to discover and the dlcs add dozens of hours more i fell in love with the characters and the story so much i even bought the books the only fault i can point out in this game is that there is so much to do you can feel overwhelmed and get burnout you can tell the developers poured their heart into this game and they did a fantastic job well done cd projekt
there are also naked ladies"
"great story very immersive"
"yes"
"dude just get it really all i can say"
"toss a coin or something"

"one of the best rpgs i have ever played"
"this game came out inand is still a benchmark should say something"
"when a humble bard
graced a ride along
with geralt of rivia
along came this song
when the white wolf fought
a silver tongued devil
his army of elves
at his hooves did they revel
they came after me
with masterful deceit
broke down my lute
and they kicked in my teeth
while the devils horns
minced our tender meat
and so cried the witcher
he cant be bleat
toss a coin to your witcher
oh valley of plenty
oh valley of plenty oh
toss a coin to your witcher
oh valley of plenty
at the edge of the world
fight the mighty horde
that bashes and breaks you
and bring you the morn oh
he thrust every elf
far back on the shelf
high up on the mountain
from whence it came
he wiped out your pest
got kicked in his chest
hes a friend of humanity
so give him the rest
thats my epic tale

"would you recommend this game to other players
in the same way that id recommend water to a hiker in the desert"
"the single greatest game of all time i know that is thrown around a lot jokingly but for fans of rpgs fantasy games and immense and detailed worldbuilding it is a must play the combat is difficult if you play on the higher settings but i started on death march the hardest difficulty and did fine after a few hours the story is great and expands on the books beautifully without changing anything if you love the game i also highly recommend the books too"
"gives wat promisses"
"the best game on the entire gaming market you literally cannot get a better story game as of rn buy it"

"for me it took a while to get used to the gta style of roaming about on a horsefast travelling to quests the combat was also not to my liking took me abouthours to get used to some of the intricacies of it all and i can say im growin to love it i know that theres a goodhours of gameplay waiting for me yet and im genuinely excited to slowly plough through it
the story voice acting graphics are beautiful beyond belief the sound and music too i just feel the gameplay of all witcher games lacks a little but ive been told to up the difficulty and tryhard it more
but regardless either way ima power through because literally every character i meet is captivating and whenever i start raging about travellingmiles on horseback im always cut short to admire the sheer beauty of the game
tldr its like mass effect but withcombat andx better everything else"
"great game the story and quests are funits a very long game overhours but dont expect this game to be like skyrim or oblivion you cant kill any friendly npcs and no one cares if yousteal anything in front of them there is no stealth system and the world doesnt feel alive no randombattles between humans and monsters or monster vs monsterthere are nocrazy random events like in elderscrolls but its still a very good game but not perfect"

"ending was ing garbage wish i didnt buy the game and didnt have to suffer like this near tohours gone to waste so disappointed"
"yes"
"amazing game just play it"
"gonna write a somewhat indepth review here because ie got nothing better to do with my life
this game can be bought nowadays fora playthrough of the entire game has taken me overhours both times once on console once on pc math isn my strong point but that a lot of value for money in terms of hours to dollars let alone when you take into account that this game is written and directed to levels i personally didn think possible in a video game from indepth lore to the vast vast even vaster with blood and wine open world detailed and individual conversation pathways and choices that can lead to one of many vastly and significantly different endings to the storyline to references to other cdprojekt games and even direct impacts to the world of witcherbased off of choices made in witchersand two
visually inthis game was a pc melter console cooker and some people even compared the demands of the visuals to that of the crysis series because of this the game still holds up nicely nearlyyears onwards yes visually it will be outclassed by metro exodus and red dead redemption two but it far from a bad looking game and more often then not looks downright stunning and those games cost x more for fewer gameplay hours
speaking of the gameplay though simple it is refined and encourages creativity in combat through the indepth character customisation levelling skill tree and even just the various ways to play the simple yet effective combat system much like the conversation system encourages the player to truly become geralt and mould his personality character and physique to fit how the player wants to play the game to extents not before seen in the series and that before you introduce the upgraded mutagen system from blood and wine
similarly to its competitor skyrim the witcherhas had a release of two significant dlc contents over its lifetime each with sets of new enemies weapons armour boss fight and storylines that rival if not surpass the main story if you enjoyed witcher books or other games or dark souls or skyrim or even sigh netflix witcher youl have nothing but love for this masterpiece this is an absolute banger of a game and a game that is a musthave for anyone who enjoys rpgs"
"vcool"
"where do i start cd projekt are absolutely amazing
i can gladly add with a smile on my face another positive review for this game that has stolen most of my time just so that i could complete the main story and feel some satisfaction and closure
the game is so emotionally attaching in which i truly feel that your choices heavily lie on how you would act in real life as a person this is what makes this game special for me for a game i purchased forim simply amazed by how much work and detail was put into the game to make it what it is
i have so much love for the characters and there role in the story which made for a fitting ending to geralts long adventure im so glad i found this game due to enjoying and giving the netflix series a watch thankyou cd projekt from the bottom of my heart
edit when i am writing this i have completed both dlcs thoroughly simply amazing how they can call a game in its self a dlc thankyou for the wonderful and immersive content that has kept me happy throughout"

pros
 the dialogue in this game is amazing you have to think so carefully about your choices
 the fights are always a good challenge they really make you think about how to fight each
opponent not to mention the swordplay
 story is ing amazing
 characters are great
overall great game"

"best game ever made"
"i truly recommend this game once you start playing you just fall in love"
"this game has waited to be played on my library for way too long its also a game that ive bought three times because i intended to play it on consoles when it first came out needless to say looking at how stunningly beautiful this game looks on pc with the maximum graphics i left the console copies to gather dust
story gameplay audio graphics the witcherdelivers top quality on each and every one of these segments itd be a waste of letters to go any deeper on to explaining how great any of those aspects are individually so lets focus on the composition of them instead
game world feels very intact and provides lots of ground and water to explore vast amount of side quests varying from bigger quest chains to simple tasks located merely ameters from quest givers are giving you a good reason to explore the world there are only few rpg games which deliver actually interesting side quests and witcher has always stood up on the top of them they do use the same character models for many of the unimportant characters yet they manage to create an unique personality for each and every one so not many become completely forgotten over the time
everything feels rewarding and the pace of the game is very well balanced i do like the fact that you are not forced to immediately familiarize yourself with all the games mechanics like alchemy and the use of mutagens if you decide to play on a lower difficulty level because for me at least chugging potions isnt something i do in any game in general when going with a higher difficulty setting however investigating the target of your hunt is mandatory along with choosing the right potions oils and decotions for the job
at the end of it all the witcherdelivers an unique experience that youll want to keep playing for hours on end its familiarizing you with the world of witchers without expecting you to have played the previous titles or missing out on the books its a game that doesnt demand a lot of skill to complete yet provides a good challenge and a variety of things to master if youd like to be challenged
only negative things i can say about the game are the few bugs here and there which i have mostly encountered when having a conversation with merchants or blacksmiths ive either got stuck to the dialogue or the shop hasnt opened at allbut this has happened about four times during myhours in the game physics can work in weird ways at some points especially if youre casting a flying monster off the sky using your aard
its also worth mentioning some of the more cinematic cutscenes tend to look very bad in comparison to the ones generated ingame using your current outfits for both geralt and the alternative ones for yen ciri and triss as well when your ingame graphic settings are all maxed out the cinematics look like theyre coming from some of the earlier games sound design is also very poorly constructed in certain scenes towards the end where they could be much more epic and have a lot more impact if they were given an tiny bit of an improvement
still a very strong recommendation for everyone who enjoys a good rpgyou dont want to miss out on the witcher"
"hmm"
"just freed dandelion side quests to complete sorry ciri"
"amazing game hard to learn the controls but the story line is amazing graphics are awould surely recommend"
"i think this game proves ive been missing out in life
so by hat ive decided to pursue my dreams as a suicidal playwright and musician and i shall also pursue amazingly interesting quirky and funny danish women"
"much fun"
"our hero geralt is a witcher a monster hunter trained since childhood to be fearsome warriors skilled in combat tracking magic and more witchers are given mutagens to make them stronger faster and resistant to toxic alchemy geralt also known as the white wolf is the protagonist of the witcher novels and games he has a relationship with triss merigold and his personality and politics are largely left up to the player witchers are meant to remain detached from conflict without taking political sides but in the first two witcher games geralt often has to make a choice between aiding humans or the persecuted nonhumans as mutants witchers comfortably fit in neither camp at the beginning of the first witcher game geralt is found near the witcher stronghold of kaer morhen wounded with his memory stolen by amnesia geralt recovers his memory over the course of the witcherand recalls that he was killed by a pitchforkwielding villager while defending a group of nonhumans his former lover the sorceress yennefer died trying to bring him back but both were saved by ciri magical powers and they lived in peace until yennefer was taken by the wild hunt geralt tracked them and made a trade his life for yennefer she was freed and geralt rode with the hunt until he somehow made his escape which is where the witcherpicks up when geralt discovers yennefer is alive he sets out to find herthere are a lot of country and city names thrown around in the first few hours of the witcherand even if you remember those names from previous games you may not remember where everything is so maps the large map to the right made for the witcherdepicts the portions of the northern kingdoms explorable in the witcherwhen the wild hunt begins the empire of nilfgaard has invaded the northern kingdoms from the south occupying large swaths of territory the witcheris mostly set in the center of this conflict in the southernmost part of the northern kingdoms one of those kingdoms is temeria where the witcheris set and it has already been conquered by nilfgaard the map below shows the boundaries of the northern kingdoms before the events of the witcherand depicts the land to the north of novigrad that isn visible in the witchermap the significant kingdoms here are redania and kaedwen who are still at war with the invading nilfgaardthats a ton of background information so youre probably wondering where does the witcherfit into all this the game primarily takes place on the temerianredanian border and skellige your goal is to find ciri before a mysterious group called the wild hunt does however the region is currently locked in a brutal war between the temerians and the nilfgaardians battlefields are piled high with corpses and many of the common folk have been displaced the politics in these games can be tough to follow but we like to think this was intentional for a few reasons first geralt being the good witcher he is shouldnt meddle with politicsemphasis on shouldnt second there are no good guys or bad guys in the world of the witcher its kings and queens mobilizing the poor to fight for them finally realworld politics are messy and for this world to feel believable the politics present should be dirty as well you could play through this whole game and still not understand why nilfgaard is at war with temeria and thats okay the witcheris about geralt ciri and their friends the more context you have the better but to some extent being confused about the state of the world is an integral part of the experiencethough one thing to keep in mind is that ordinary folk typically dont trust witchers sorceresses and nonhumans simply because theyre different the socalled free state of novigrad is currently in the middle of a bloody witch hunt sorceresses and nonhumans are being burned at the stake the surviving dwarves elves and sorceresses are being pushed into ghettos or forced to go into hiding while theres no law against witchers yet most people are scared or intimidated by geralt when they see him the hatred for nonhumans and sorceresses can be traced to the church of the eternal fire and king radovid the eternal fire was founded in novigrad and its followers believe that the eternal fire will guide them through hardships they also hate nonhumans sorceresses and monsters while king radovid seems relatively indifferent towards nonhumans he specifically hates sorcerers and sorceresses especially one named philipa eilhart because of this king radovid turns a blind eye to the church of eternal fires intolerant behavior presumably as a result of the hatred and violence brewing from this social climate the lodge of sorceresses is a shell of its former self the oncepowerful group of sorceresses played a significant role in the realms politics although some of their tactics were shady many of them advised kings and influential people currently its members are dead or in hiding however the game doesnt begin south of the novigrad and redanian border after a lengthy tutorial segment in white orchard you start your quest in velen a wartorn region commonly referred to as no mans land here you will find a series of small impoverished villages under the watchful protection of the bloody baron meanwhile geralts friends are scattered around the region triss was last seen in novigrad yenn after your short introduction to her is chasing up leads in skellige and dandelion is missing as geralt you must search for ciri and your friends while navigating the worlds tumultuous political climate and hidden conspiracies theres much to uncover but everything weve detailed should be more than enough to prepare you for the massive journey ahead

"witcher iii has become one of if my my favorite game of alltime its storytelling routes and worldbuilding are secondtonone in this roleplaying game you can play as you see fit taking on the role of a true hero selfish evildoer or the true witcher pathsomewhere in the middle
combat mechanics arent the best and the way leveling works means that youll pretty constantly be looking to improve your gear which distracts from the main pointthe story the quests and story are however well worth playing the expansions also only add to an already great game but they are best purchased and played after completing the story at least once since theyre highlevel quests unless you make a profile specifically to play them i cannot recommend this game enough for fans of roleplaying decision storydriven andor fantasy games"

especially exceptionalis imo that the choices actually feel meaningful and the game doesnt destroy that like so many others by a binary good option bad option here are your lightdark side points and your ending mechanic the choices are hard ones to make and there is no clear right or wrong you will often leave wondering have i done the right thing
it is also oneof the few games that get open world right by giving you a vast world to explore but still keeping that world small enough to be able to keep it interesting
no eldar scrolls havent i been in this villagetimes before feeling here
every place feels fresh and wherever you go there is something interesting to discover
all in all just a masterpiece"

"the witcherwild hunt is one of the few masterpieces that has raised the roof in rpgs in terms of captivating storytelling dynamic characters and gameplay the amount of details put into the lore and characters are one of most outstanding feats of this work the gameplay allows numerous ways of playing and rewards them rightfully so within the story i completely respect even admire the amount of passion and care that cd projekt red in developing this game in spite of humble beginnings theres hardly any rpgs that can compete the character and charisma i am hoping to see more of this type of work from cd projekt red in the future ie cyberpunk"

"the game continue the story of geralt after the books
note you are not in need to read all the books and played the lastgames before this to start your first adventure in this universe so if you are totaly new it is totaly okej and the game is made with that in mind i recommend not to rush this game
the world in this game is built with love respect and life you will notice it clearly while playing it enjoy every mark on your map do as many rec all side quests as possible visit every town and accept all the witchers contracts why you may ask well to be completely honest the side quests free roam adventures people you meet and talk to random encounters with monsters spirits ghastly looking nightmares are absolutely masterful crafted everything is living breathing things that bring a real soul to the game they are not boring and filled with suprises to keep you entertained
you can replay the game like a new game great thing to explore the game in nooks and cranies where you havent done before
the story is well done and great written to have good progress and understanding i recommend not to skip dialogs and choose the white options before you continue with the yellow ones in the dialogs
enojy the game like it where you who was the witcher geralt of rivia enojy the game for what it is a absolute masterpice will hold the crown of being the best rpg in year to come
ps
do not blame cdpr and the witcher when you have completed the game once or more and no other game like it will satisfy you as muchhappend to me xd

"in my opinion the best rpg ive ever played after elder scrolls v skyrim
lets break it down shall we
 the graphics in this game is fantastic its beautiful and stunning you could walk around watching the trees swaying around and relax yourself just by watching and admiring the landscape
 the combat system is also fun some mini bosses will make you think before attacking and the bosses also very challenging each one of them well except if you are fighting a lower level boss you can use potions and oils which will help you fight against certain of monsters
 the missionsso far i am yet to finish the main mission of the game still finishing the side missions no the side missions are not like what you think it is its fun you can make contracts which you will be fighting a rare monster this one is so challenging help most people in need some fetch quests of course you can also be an actor in a play
 the soundtracksoh boy i love it from boss music fighting music different areas you will stumble upon that one soundtrack that will just scare theout of you its very fitting to the atmosphere and i love it
 the world is so immersivefrom the small village of white orchard to the no mans land of velen you will feel like you are inside the game people working around children are playing and singing the birds chirping i am absolutely speechless its also an open world game but some parts are separated
 skill treeits simplistic and easy to understand you can go with different builds go offense or magical etc
 dont know how to fight this certain enemy or anything in general theres a bestiary where you can read about monsters and other magical creatures you can read about their weaknesses and strategize before going for the monster bounty and theres also a toturial tab where it will explains back what you just missed in the first toturial
okay heres the negative part
 button to do things its very hard to loot something sometimes you need to dance around near the object to let the use button to appear or else you cant even loot it or use it its annoying
 the shoparmorerblacksmith icon disappear from the world map are you kidding me arent those icons suppose to show up because ive already discovered them god damn it now i need to circle around the town to find that armorer back
well that is all i give the witcheranicely done cd projekt red cant wait for cyberpunkthanks for reading my review"
"big cool is cool so very cool it give me brain hemorage when i die because it fun poo"
"seems like a fantastic game storyrich and so many surprisinglyinteresting side quests"
"had already put over at least h on the console version and now finally bought it on pc cuz this game and the developers deserve all the love and money they can get
one of the best wrpgs out there i put it on par with top series like elder scrolls fallout and dragon age
compared to witcherthis one is a massive improvement in every possible way
fun combat massive and extremely detailed open world cool and interesting main secondary and even minor characters around at least a hundred sidequests that range from simple errands to actually well written sidestories beautiful graphics and it all runs perfectly due to how good the game was optimizedwhich is rare for pc games etc etc etc
this is one of the few games that has a lot of pros and not many cons and its hard for me to even think of something bad to say about witcherso i might as well not say anything
really the game is that good i fell in love with geralt and ciri to the point it makes me sad that geralts story ended with this game"
"best rpg"
"winds howlin"
"the witcheris an epic length game that is not for everyone if your expecting a story about a nameless protagonist who goes off and slays foes a la the elder scrolls you will not get that this is a game with a named protagonist geralt who is a well established character you play geralt not your own character and some people will hate that another is combat can be awkward or boring for some and that could be a massive turn off for people that was an obligatory criticism so i can be somewhat fair and balanced because i love this game imhours into my first playthrough and i havent even finished half of skellige granted im playing on the hardest difficulty if you enjoy this game there is an incredibly large amount of things to do hundreds of quests hundreds of marked and unmarked locations i saw a review where someone said everywhere you can explore is marked with a question mark on the map that is wrong there are quite a few unmarked areas in the game and quite a few of those unmarked areas hold side quests you can accept and do now side quests in the witcherare interesting some are shortminute quests while others are longerquest long multi hour side stories the witcher contracts at least to me have always been interesting with unique named versions of standard enemies or unique enemies altogether another thing about contracts is based on geralts observations you can sometimes figure out what monster it is before the game even tells you based off of past battles and the bestiary the expansions hearts of stone and blood and wine are supposedly pretty good but i have yet to reach them another thing and maybe im in the minority here but i love gwent i have just finished getting every base game gwent card and i still play it constantly i have probably spenthours of my game time playing gwent and i regret none of it for the uninitiated gwent is a card game in the witcherand it is in my opinion the best game inside a game ive played ever cannot wait for cyberpunkto see where cdpr goes from here and who knows we might be lucky and receive a witcher four although ill hold off on those theories until i see the ending of witcherfor now though im off to continue playing"

"ing badass"
"afterhours on my first playthrough there is still so much to do that is some seriously good value that being said it has never once felt like a chore and is definitely the most engrossing story and world i have experienced in a game highly recommend"
"very good"
"yes"
"after owning the game for almost two years now and having watched the great tv series i gave it another try
when i first played it i thought id sort of slide into it and acclimatise like i did and still do with a lot of other games sadly this wasnt true for any of the witcher games including part three despite the gorgeous graphics and high detail the story feels way too linear battle mechanics make me feel like a console person not being able to save where and when you want is an unnecessary pain in theinside a singleplayer game and the fact that you cant wield any weapon you find seems a bit off also a first person mode would have been an immersive addition to such a great open world its obviously a huge game with lots of good ideas and character but to me it feels like getting off on the wrong foot each time i play it
all in all i tried to dive into it but a weird lack of atmosphere doesnt let mehard to explain and yet subjective still a reason for me not to recommend it"
"excellent creates an immersive story experience with many hardcore and softcore gaming experiences"
"youll never convince me that this isnt one of the greatest video games ever created"
"the best but you have to play the old games to understand somethings in the story i recommend to watch on youtube all the cutscenes for the older games"
"originally i played and beat the game on my playstation a little over two years ago in my recent journey into pc gaming and the netflix series giving me an itch to scratch i wanted to attempt to beat the game again and do the dlc which i failed to even try on the console version and even though i played the main story line before i enjoyed every moment i have played i have been playing the dlc for the first time and they do not fail to disappoint in the slightest after beating the main story line slowly and while doing sidequests treasure hunts witcher contracts etc and beating the hearts of stone dlc ive just started the blood and wine dlc and feel there is still a mountain of things to do and after all that theres still ng i wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone whos a fan of rpgs medieval fantasies a fan of the netfix show or just plain old likes to play fantsastic video games"

"many more hours on my other account this game has it all"
"as a preface so you know where i came from regarding this game i was just looking for top rated good looking games to test my newly built computer out on i frankly had no interest in this game other than the fact that the graphics were breathtaking and still are inand that the game was rated well i had no interest in the witcher or even sword fighting for that matter so it would have taken a lot to impress me but let me tell you i was and still am blown away
this game combines the most important aspects of a single player rpg combat game the combat is fun there are many different ways to fight and lots of different perks and boosts to help you in your battles if you invest the time to findbrewunlock them the progression system is well thought out allowing one to focus on any different playstyle at once but also allowing one to spec into just one the loot and drops are balance and keep the fights exciting for the loot at the end i could go on about this but ill go now to the story which is awesome not only are all the characters both prominent and interesting but their fates are decided by you the player you want to rush through the game just to find out what happens to your friends and your enemies
to sum up this game is well worth every penny i would buy it fortoday and it is almostyears old now"

"the writing in the game is some of the best ive ever heard and thats including most movies

everyone brings their a game even in the most menial of contracts

best story ever put in a video game heck better story than most movies and tv shows

yennifers
are beautiful and her
is hot i couldnt wait to show her my
i almost cried when one of the characters died and really cared about everyone

everything has a purpose and feels important there are many ways to approach combat

while i couldnt play on the highest setting it still looked beautiful

it is nothing short of incredible none of the tracks get old even afterhours

i only encountered a few very minor bugs and for a world as big as this ones thats pretty impressive

the witcheris a game that defies all logic and has zero flaws that matter the game is so good in fact that a part of me doesnt recommend it because every other game will look mediocre by comparison the only possible negative i can find is the lighting is a bit too dark inside buildings but that might just be me

warning the game is mature there is blood language and s

"worth the money toss a coin to cd projeckt red oh gameplay of plenty
when a humble boy
graced this game on sale
with geralt of rivia
along came this song
from when thesian boy thought
a wallet full of gold
his pantry of noodles
at his tummy the growled
they came after me
with masterful deceit
broke down my wallet
and he bought this game then
while the devs smiled
minced our tender hands
and so cried the witcher
he can be beat
chorus
toss a coin to cd projeckt red
o missions of plenty
o missions of plenty
toss a coin to cd projeckt red
o missions of plenty
verse 
at the edge of the world
fast travel appears
reached the worlds edge
none but devils play past here
he thrust every mage
far back on their beds
high up on the mountain
from whence he finally came
he wiped out your pest
got kicked in his chest
he a friend of humanity
so give him his gwent
that my epic tale
a champion prevailed
defeated the villain
now pour him some ale
chorus
toss a coin to cd projeckt red
o missions of plenty
o missions of plenty
toss a coin to cd projeckt red
o missions of plenty

"simply amazing cant wait to see what cyberpunk will turn out to be too"
"witcheris a massive game theres so much to do so much to see ive put fifty hours into it and i think im barely halfway through the main questline
did i enjoy those fifty hours not really no witcherfeels like a singleplayer mmoits designed to waste your time and make you feel like youre accomplishing things when in fact youre just mindlessly following the golden quest marker on your minimap
what made me uninstall and write this review was when after killing a beast and needing to return to town to get the quest reward i got on my horse and literally did nothing but hold the a button for a full minute while my horse autopathfinded back to town
the writing isnt terrible if you like fairly generic fantasy stories but the storytelling is brought down by the terrible animation during cutscenes with lots of awkward silences and npcs wobbling around in their idle animations
combat is braindead every enemy has one or two attacks they do in a very repetitive pattern normal combat flow is strong attack two quick attacks roll back to avoid the attack they launch
despite being a massive game i never experienced a sense of mystery or felt the desire to explore almost everything you can do shows up as question marks on your map although its a little bit like comparing apples to plums breath of the wild is a much better game in this regard
a lot of the game systems are just annoying alchemythe crafting of potions and whatnottakes ingredients mostly flowers or mushrooms you find growing out in the world but in the game engine plants are containers meaning you press a on a flower and it opens the container menu and you have to press a again to gather it
using potions is another hasslealthough there are a lotof different ones with a variety of interesting effects you only havepotion quickuse slots you cant use potions straight from your inventory so you have to put them in a slot first which is annoying even worse is that every time you open your inventory it resets what tab youre on so you have to renavigate to the potions tab if you want to switch it out again and worst of all since theres so many they all kind of blend together and so if you want to use that one potion you remember having you have to select it wait half a second for the description to pop up select the next one etc if youre unlucky youll have to do that twenty or thirty times before you find the one you wanted
in summary this game is vast but shallow and poorly designed but also cunningly crafted to hit your dopamine receptors as often as possible playing this game will be massive waste of your time"

"great game good story and lore also nice combat mechanics and overall game design two thumbs up"
"the witcheris a borderline masterpiece
ive played the previous two installments and both were great in some aspects and lacking in others meanwhile the third makes up for pretty much everything the story is extremely engaging and really makes you feel the moral weight of some of the choices you have to make and the consequences since nothing is truly blackwhite the gameplay is fun and enjoyable aside from its occasional clunky moments also on higher difficulties it really is extremely engaging doing various builds and using plenty of the oils and potions making you truly feel like a witcher the world is beautiful and fun to explore and theres plenty to do and see with monster contracts side quests treasure hunts and of course gwent overall the base game is amazing its fun engaging immersive and exciting it truly does make you feel like youre geralt
ill also include opinions of both dlcs below
hearts of stone is an interesting experience and adds a bunch of more things to do to the one major area as well as adds a whole new in game enchantment mechanic which adds something new to combat its not extremely long but its challenging and interesting also the potential sword you can receive as a reward is incredible i will add anotherhours of fun to what youve already enjoyed
now blood and wine is a different beast this adds a ton of new content being a whole new area enemies items and combat mechanic to the game enough to almost be its own game in itself its story is fantastic and also helps new players become even more familiar with the previous lore of the series the new creatures are both a nice change and also challenging at times the new mechanic of mutations adds a whole new level to the combat and builds and to top it all off toussaint is absolutely beautiful this will add hours of things to do and chase in both quests contracts and most of all gwent
overall its a fantastic game with excellent expansions outside of a few gameplay flaws and rare bugs this game is a gem and easily one of the best games of the past decade a must play and must buy"

"firstly this game is not perfect but what game is everything and anything can be improved upon but this games positives outshines its own flaws which are already easily passable in the first place cd projekt red nailed it on the execution
the music complements your surroundings so well
a calm melancholic flute singing a story of the barren mountains and ruins bygone days while you gallop through them on your horse its breathtaking
the intense buildup of drums and the battle cry of a valkyrie while you fight a battle against a wild monster its epic
one of the best soundtracks ive heard from a game seriously though have a listen to kaer morhen and fields of ard skellig
i like games with characters that make me feel strong emotion toward them that way i know they are written well enough to motivate me to push through the story every major character is unique with personalities and contributes to the plot in a way that will influence your decisions by poking your emotions this is one of those games that do a great job at this
can i also mention how great the facial animations are i can tell cdpr put extra effort in the facial animation in moments where it really mattered they deserve praise for that
now theres a chance youre reading reviews to see if the purchase would be worth your money my answer is yes absolutely even more so when on sale
i finished the main story at my own pace in a little overhours ive completed hearts of stone expansion in abouthours i still havent near finished the blood and wine expansion so again yes its one of the most satisfying purchases on a game

this game has beautiful interactive cutscenes and the dialogue choices that you choose can carry consequences the gameplay is dynamic and allows the player to choose which skills to prioritize which swords to use which oils and concoctions to use etc i personally enjoy using witcher signs so i invested skill points into the sign intensity skills the games hardest difficulty is very challenging and will require a fair bit of patience as well as knowledge and skill however the game truly shines with the lore it is story rich with depth and was a very enjoyable play through this is a game where you can expect to play through the story multiple times since it is that good i know i have overall this is the best game i have ever owned on steam and still enjoy playing it today pick it up and play it you wont regret it dlcs are an added bonus

this game is pretty easy to get the hang of on easy mode the hardest part for me has been getting the walking down ive often walked just past characters to talk to and boxes to loot and needed to turn around to try again im also uncoordinated in general so this is accurate to me irl
you also dont have to play macgyverly if thats not your thing you can push for moremoney per contracthelping others and other notsonice things
if all that sounds like your deal you should give this game a shot"

"took me a bit to get into it but very happy i did"
"guess whos very late to the party well im not very far into the game heres what i have to say though
combat is kind of boring to me since every type of enemy shares its own fighting pattern dont get me wrong its neat how each enemy is different but it means enemies are predictable once you memorize the pattern which doesnt take long as someone whos never played any other witcher games the plot is confusing thats not the games fault its mine so i recommend watchingplaying the other games because i personally am confused lets see what else graphics are nice got some good screenshots the game runs fast on my somewhat lousy gaming laptop roach is a pain in the rear end to control imo even when hes on autopilot i get annoyed with controlling him roach is the horse btw other than that great game lovely gameplay and voice acting"

"this game is awesome"
"great game the overwhelmingly positive rating across the board sums it up that should tell you almost all that you need to know before diving in the only thing i would say that that doesnt explain is that at least a summary style youtube like understanding of the previous two games and how they relate to the books might be beneficial youtube search witcherback story or something to that effect and you should get some pretty helpful videos either that or read the book series and play the first two games none of which is completely necessary you could get by if you skipped all of that including the witchersummary but you might find yourself a little lost to many of the major characters and references but it would totally be playable still but either way i definitely have to recommend playing the witcheri would have to call it the best and most influential game of the last decade i say influential in that it seemed like the next ten games i played after the witcher all tried to copy some element of it or even the entire feel so if youre debating it stop being a wishy washy indecisive coward and buy the damned game"

"an excellent open world style game that just keeps on giving packed with memorable characters stories and great visuals supported by a vast mod community this is the game of the year every year"
"i really wish valve will let is choose a better rating system instead of just yes or no i really enjoyed this game but it was far from perfect
pros
for a game thats almostyears old this is an absolutely gorgeous game it has a very lengthy storyline that really gives you a run for your money choices you make in game affect the outcome of the storyline so you might be inclined to play it multiple times theres a lot to this game that youll have to learn crafting potions armor mutations and lets not forget gwent if youre going to play this game dont expect to know how to play it in a single afternoon one thing i really love about it is how large the map is and how there are so many places to explore
cons
there are a few downsides primarily the controls good lord the controls are awful at times when i first picked up the game i couldnt grasp my head around why there was so much input lag turns out thats just a feature of the game smh trying to get roach to move is painful as theres a delay for when you want him to sprint many times hell just stop on his own which is annoying the worst part is trying to swim i almost died because i was stuck under a rock while under water also this is the type of game you play for the story not combat the combat isnt very exciting as its very repetitive most of the time its just me jumping around button mashing the dodge button while trying to sneak in attacks if you really value a unique combat system this game is not for you
conclusion
this game is for people who value a great story and fantastic scenery over exciting game mechanics and combat i absolutely recommend the dlcs but wait for them to be on sale"
"great game"
"very good story
decent mechanics dont be discouraged by the game in the beggining as you will ghet used to it in a short while"
"after watching the netflix series over the holidays i returned to my long but unfinished playthrough of witcherand its time i heaped more deserved praise onto this amazing game
im glad i watched the tv series directly based on the books before getting to the heart of this story because ive never seen a video game that provides more faithful continuity to its original property in addition to standing on its own as an unforgettable piece of well written acted and visually directed story it continues and even concludes plotlines from the booksepisodes in a fitting and fulfilling way
and that is just the main plot i cant say enough about the threads that bind this together as a video game and as a living breathing world to explore many others have already said it better than i could
while i wish it had a more complex combat system battles are exhilarating and satisfying many side quests are so immersive you dont care about the reward or exp you just want to see what happens next the hard hitting choices you make when deciding the fate ofthese well acted npcs even the random quest guys might weigh on you long after their time in the story is done
if you enjoy open world action games and rpgs be it botw skyrim on down to the ac series you will find here a shining example of the genre done right if you havent been exposed to the witcher universe yet i recommend you watch the series on netflix and then see that plot be brought to a brilliant conclusion in this game"
"this game is an excellent rpg that ive been addicted to the story honestly is not something im terribly into but the writing dialogue options and side missions make for a fun game the combat is varied and there are many items to work and upgrade i feel like ive barely touched this game but afterhours i feel like i could recommend to anyone on the fence of purchasing"

"so what can a subjectively minded fair opinion look like for a witcherreviewthe game is a solid bin some areas it absolutely excels such as the narrative acting writing the length of plot in questsbut in other areas it feels like a game made by absolute amateurssuch as fighting mechanics balance menus itemization
in alot of ways the game has an entertainment value thats worth overlooking its short comings the characters and world is well fleshed out and very immersivebut for someone like myself who is a life long game player and a fan of action games and action rpgs there are some serious serious novice mistakes made in this gameso much so that if youre really picky about that sort of thing youd be hard pressed to finish this game
starting with the cons
the combat system is a real fine example of form over functionyou can tell it was designed by artists not designers of action gameplay mechanicsthere is a strong focus on the look and fluidity of combat but this comes at an immense expense of loose controls and lack of real player optionsthere are systems in the game that have you constantly pause combat to apply oils to your weapons for added damage or menus to move through different spells that instead of playing off each other are used as specific spells against specific monster weaknessesso if you dont remember what a monster is weak to you have to pause combat go into your glossary bestiary file through a cluttered menu to find the monsters info apply oil equip spell and finally unpause the gamethis kind of design is something teachers in a game design schoolshould use as a clear example of how not to make an action oriented game
menus in the game are very poorly designed and there are an astonishing amount of items to pick up and grab that just become a blur of ingredients for alchemical recipes you dont haveagain many of these choices are about the look of the witcher instead of how it feels to play
there are many more cons to the combat and action and menus i could nitpick but you get the idea
the pros are for sure the dialog acting writing and overall plot and feel of the worldmuch of the craftsmanship and focus of the game is obviously in this departmentits just a shame they didnt have anyone in the gameplay design room who knew anything about video games
overall if you can buy the game on sale it is a fun world to experiencebut dont listen to fanboys drool on and on about this game being amazingin my opinion only a really novice player of action games with ill formed opinions would find a game like this well made"

"in three hours i have slain monsters solved crimes and been surprised by the depth of story telling all this and i have not even scratched the surface of this game the only nitpick ive come across is the default method of utilizing heavy attack on a keyboard holding left shift and then clicking left mouse is finicky at best i just assigned heavy attack to another mouse key and never looked back
but on sale but is worth its full price"

"one of the best games ive ever played right up there with skyrim gothic and modern warfare i love open world games where its easy to spend hundreds of hours unlike some games where afterhours you have completed the story line
great story great controls great look i wish there was a way to turn on a family friendly mode i usually play this when my kids are in bed in the evening or early in the morning however sometimes i dont hear them coming and they walk in when theres an inappropriate moment or language
i keep thinking im at the end of the game but it just keeps going i was letting it drag out for a while as i was trying to complete all the side quests but now im trying to finish the game and it seems that there is no end every time i think the main plot missions will be the last it leads me to another quest to get one more person or piece of the puzzle i like it that its not just an easy end but its almost frustrating at the same time how it seems to be dragging on and on still love the game though"

"this game is incredible the combat is pretty easy to pick up pretty much just smashing the same button over and over again the story lines that you find in this game are some of the best in any game that i have ever played the world is also the most dense world i have ever played it feels like there is more to do in one city then there are in other rpgs combined the character progression and options you have to choose from with gear is absolutely great and beating a hard boss feels rewarding when you get a nice new weapon to show off to your friends
gwent is something that is difficult to pick up but when you get the hang of it and get some good cards it immediately becomes addicting and almost as rewarding as beating a difficult boss i found myself lost in these gwent matches wanting more and trying to get even more powerful cards
i have spent abouthours in the game and im not even out of velen yet this game is one of the best games i have ever played"

"great"
"i dont think theres anything more that needs to be said its the witcheramazing video game"
"the game even on its lowest settings is beautiful and runs surprisingly smoothly even on a system that is far from high end the story is engaging and the open world is rather exactly that if you want you can spend hours upon hours merely exploring completely ignoring the story alternately you can stick to the story if thats your deal and you will still be able to finish the game on lower difficulty levels having playing through an interesting game
i highly recommend it as an aside i understand that this game ties far more into the canon of the book series than the first two
finally if you intend on playing all three i
recommend playing them in order for starters there are references to past games and your choices there can have an impact on the events of subsequent games additionally the control scheme is better with each game and you likely will not want to go back"
"you finally arrive at this small village before you enter the nearest tavern you see this notice board full of ripped and teared posts on it reading these worried summaries of horrible things that have been happening to the poor people here your mind begins to wander only if their pleas could be helped only if there was someone out there in amidst of all this horrible war this famine this suffering that could put an end to their problems someone who could make life easier if only for a little bit you snap from your thoughts and with two swords on your back one steel one silver each for different kinds of monsters you pick up these pieces of old yellow paper these pieces of almost lost hope you mount your trusty horse and you go to their aid even if all they think of you and your kind is that youre murderers youre butchers youre greedy and disgusting mutants despite all that you keep going not only because its your way of life and your job but also because you know youre their only chance of living another day instead of being murdered by a drowner"

"i have only rated one game in my life and it was sw fallen order i am not a professional but when a game catches your interest the way the witcher series has its hard not to give mycents
i will mention now that i found out about mods about a quarter of the way through the main game im using a mod manager to launch the game and this disables steams time tracker i assumethe hours shown on my profile are not accurate im not sure how many hours i play honestly but its probably aroundorokay to the review
nearlyyears after its initial release the witcherwild hunt has held up as if yrden was used on the entirety of the fanbase even newcomers to the franchise as myself i have rarely had an instance where the witcherdidnt pop up in a conversation for what do you think the best game this decade was rightfully so i may add starting my first game save only a week ago i didnt ever think i could be entertained by an open world like this from the start of the game to the end of only the main story i was hooked and hated having to take breaks from the game after beating the game and swallowing the hard truth that its time to find a new game the games main menu and quest screen caught my eye with blue and red tints after the sole game cd projekt red did something that game companiesyears later have struggled with doing im looking at you divisionthe witchersomehow managed to re open up the creative and thriving continent that we love for their dlc heart of stoneblood and wine while i have only completed heart of stone i can say i am a few missions into blood and wine and am still somehow glued to my screen more than ever the witcheris anyear old breath of fresh air that is without a doubt a pathway for the now delayed cyberpunkto excel in the genre
tldr buy the game and enjoy every last minute of it and dont forget to toss a coin to your witcher
edit i completely forgot to mention the well thought out skill system that allows you to have many different combinations of skills and mutagens that each give a unique boost of healthintensity of sings aswell as gives geralt new abilities that are only active when activated into your skill tree"

it has allmost everything you would like from a game of its kind
graphics and sound are superb monsters characters and level design is also top tier
pretty much the only thing it lacks a bit is combat mechanics which could be better but im being honest when i say that the game otherwise is so good that in reality you dont even mind
a must buy for everyone playing video games i would say truly a masterpiece comparable to games like ocarina of time on n and other mamoth titles of their times"

"the good news its exactly as good as its reputation
a topnotch rpg with heaps of complexity simplebuthardtomaster combat character development crafting and a huge lovely lively world to play around in but the best part of the game is everything is meaningful dialogue choices you thought were just flavour come back to haunt you even small sidequests are lovingly detailed there is no collectbear hides here if something corresponds to standard rpg formula it is lampshaded or subverted cleverly
i cannot emphasise enough how big a difference that makes
the one flaw i would complain about is that for a game with such soulslike combat youd expect soulslevel controls fluent and responsive and perfected instead i often find myself grappling with camera and controls as much as my actual enemies but not to the point of making it unbearable
overall an immensely pleasant experience cdpr have delivered their masterpiece and if youre thinking of buying this do it"

"yes
this game is at first quite vast but if you stick to it for a while it will reveal some awesome and cool gamestuffs there is much to choose from dont want witcher swords boom axes dont want witcher gear but would rather look like a noble snobby geralt at your service
want to befriend everyone or kill everything in one hit dont the guards start off at levelish and will beat the living daylight out of you

to enjoy the game instead of just enjoying the game
this game is complex and there is a lot of things going for it but at no point did anything really wow me the combat dialog visuals stories music exploration and overall gameplay just werent that good really i havent played any of the other witcher games so the dialog often feels contrived and pointless since it often calls back to previous information that was established in a different gamebook i wanted to enjoy this game i really did but it just sucks man it sucks on all fronts if you enjoy this game power to you but this just aint my cup of tea"

cudos to the developing team coming this far but i feel like theyre getting a tad bit too much credits a descent open world but its not breath of the wild its an ok hack n slash rpg but its not dark souls its a great story but its not tolkien
in the end everything feels like a choir thats only fueled by my own ocd playing gwent with the same old deck hello northern kingdoms doing fetch quests and blowing up another monster den just to get rid of the question mark on the map gets really repetitive to the point that i cant even reprehend how they where able to put in that much voice acting into this seemingly endless grindfest
i recommend it because the main story is pretty exciting and it looks amaze ballz but i wish theyd skip the open world gimmick because its clunky and very unrewarding"

the amazing almost flawless story paired with a well thought out gameplay loop and mechanics are a nice change from other rpgs actually this game puts some aaa rpgs to shame with decisions playing a huge part in how the world and loot and your character changes throughout the game
the story is amazing with a nice and consistent tone and characters feel like organic human beings not just some drones only living to play out role like sell be a gang leader or be a disposable guard instead everyone has feelings and their own interests making a huge impact in how you play the game
but it does not stop there the blood and wine expansion is also a perfect example of what expansionsdlc are meant to be introducing a new land with a completely different color palette which is a nice change form the main games gloomy feel that and the massive amount of content and rich story line makes this one of the best dlc or expansion to ever be released for a already amazing game"
"witcheris an awesome title to play and own there is a novel series if you like literature and seasonis available for viewing on netflixi enjoyed the netflix and game adaptations very much please consider downloading and playing this title geralt takes the role as a neutral character he defies the stereotypical good guy role of most hero titles instead he often chooses his own path one beautiful woman at a time"

"a truly great gamegraphics are quite nice even by the standard ofthough to truly enjoy the game i have a couple of tips
 be patient for the firstlevels as leveling up at the beginning of the game white orchard is extremely slow
 sign casting mechanic is quite awkward if you want to cast different signs in quick succession try googling for instant sign casting witcherand youll find a better mechanic whether youre using a controller or a kbmouse combo as for myself i created a new steam controller configuration so that l and r buttons are used for instant casts and shortcuts
 playing this game with a controller will have a smoother experience than a kbmouse combo navigating around the game with a mouse is possible but erratic mouse movements is just headacheinducing imo the motion blur setting in witcherdoesnt seem to be as effective as ones in other games eg jedi fallen order is much more playable with a mouse but then again its a much more recent game"

and yes buy the only when its on sale the devspublisher earned enough money already
dont get me wrong the game is good its really good but not a masterpiece
why because it has minor yet existing bugs design flaws which break the immersionatmosphere at least imo
just a few that i encountered so far
 cant leave conversation screen with esc button only with numeric keys
 sometimes cant use axiis puppet upgradesubskill it doesnt matter how long i press q it just doesnt work often
 also when using puppet time slows down for the player and the mobs too at least it seems however sometimes nontargeted mobs are not slowing down so you dont have enough time to perform the sign
 once again the puppet spell who was the idiot who think thatseconds are needful to cast that spell if every mob would slow down maybe it would make sense but no see above
 roach the horseoh boy talking about stupid ai instead of the demanding hair animations cdpr should have worked more on ai you cant jump on roach while running because he cant keep upcant catch up
 roach the horseroach can follow the road if you hold down shift button only
yes but he cant follow the road which leads to the quests mark ffs where were the testers at this point
 conversation screen i you start talking to some npc mostly merchants blacksmiths it doesnt turn to you but you teleport in front of it thanks to this awesome mechanicfeature sometimes i end up places where its difficult to get out from

let me just say that i have amassed around hrs in this game on all platforms i bought the pc version a while back but never got around to playing it on pc properly i have recently decided to replay the game in its entirety on pc
this game is a goddamn masterpiece everything from the graphics to storytelling is topnotch the character development is indepth and captivating to say the least and after the amount of time i have spent playing the game on all platforms im still not bored by the witcherit is that good
oh and not only is the base game incredible the dlcs are works of art blood and wine especially it blew my freaking mind
there is a reason this game has such a massive following and insanely high reviews cdpr have poured their hearts and souls into developing this game they know exactly what the fan base are looking for and mold the ingame experience based on that kudos to you cdpr you absolute gods xd

"no better value in gaming"
"cmon man just play this game"
"graphics
the game has excellent level and world design with plenty of variety and realism still looks great in 
music
nice variety of musical scores all well done and not boring
voiceovers
one of the best games ive heard when it comes to voiceovers theyve done everything right here
story
fantastic story with some twists and turns plenty of sidequests all over the map that encourages exploration and helps to immerse yourself in the character lots of content that is new and doesnt go back to old cookie cutter stuff
gameplay
this game is a joy to play it is a lot of fun traversing the different areas of the large map fighting swarms of well placed and interesting enemies this really is its own world that doesnt simply copy and paste ideas from other rpgs
you can choose to do the large number of sidequests or skip them entirely and head straight down the main quest line the chooseyourown adventure style of choices presented in the game offer good replay value some of those choices do affect the world at large including the end game content
gripes
the combat gets quite repetitive and involves far too much dodging and rolling around to evade enemy attacks it is more aggravating button mashing and luck than strategy if you are lucky you can kill enemies well above your level but you are going to sit there forminutes doing it which is often not worth it
while many of the items and loot drops in the game are not level dependent weapons and armors do scale to your character level facing off with difficult enemies way above your level may be a fun challenge but is ultimately unrewarding since you will only receive weapon and armor for your current level char
if you are a player that likes to grind this is not the game for you nearly all relevant experience comes from doing the main questline likewise perform subquests before you are at a reasonable level can hamstrimg your character
otherwise great game"

"the witcherwild hunt is a game ive been putting off for a while either due to not playing the original two its clunky controls or its large openworld that goes on and on with no seeming end in sight for working a fulltime job it can be a daunting task
fortunately after watching netflixs the witcher i gave it another chanceand boy do i regret not playing it earlier while many have already graced us with raving reviews i hope to provide a bit of insight from someone who has a fulltime job has barely any time to play many games but decided upon this one
after watching the witcher it gave me a real sense of the world i was jumping into nilfgaard mages witchers temeria and the like many people who look for the skyrim itch the witcher can seemingly scratchbut its more than just that the witcher brings forth lore that is easily digestible characters that you can get to know and appreciate playing this game felt more like watching netflixs the witcher more than playing a game which i thoroughly enjoyed as i could break between sessions knowing i felt like ive always accomplished something even if its my th round of gwent in a row
something that is so enthralling is the writing and cinematography while yes the cutscenes of conversations are like any other the writing is constantly interesting and while i do skip a bit i more than regularly get caught up in the daytoday of the bloody barons family life or triss escape from novigrad
its combat can be summed up as a dark soulesque gameplay thats it its simple albeit a bit clunky but its always satisfying seeing the limbs of my enemies flying the level progression is enjoyable and provides some very beneficial if not a bit overpowered perks and really provides some satisfaction once completing a long story arc
somethings i absolutely despise is the customisation limited although varied styles of haircuts and beards all the designs of clothes are absolutely horrific bar some of the doublets that dont serve as any realworld use otherwise ive tried to keep with the default armour which ive been able to upgrade once in novigrad but never again i wish there was better designs if not just continually upgrading the existing default armour in replacing the ones i find although i have not put too much effort in finding other witcher armours so i may be surprised in the future
the menus while simple can sometimes be clunky when i mean to go into the pause menu to check out my gwent cards i often end up in my gameplay menu i wish there was an easier way to move between them although thats just nitpicking
do i recommend this to people absolutely i would suggest watching netflixs the witcher first to get a full view of what to expect as the witcherwild hunt plays very well off the story you see in the show"
"is guud"

"the witcheris the last game in the witcher series and is the largest and grandest by far fans ofandwill immediately be drawn intoand players new to the series have if they want a reasonable first game to play the story is self contained and although it contains heavy references to previous games and is definitely best enjoyed by playing the previous two first it stands along if the player wants to enjoy it that way
at its core the game is the same as the previous games the player is geralt of rivia an alchemy powered monster hunter a witcher who adventures through the world getting tangled up in anything and everything in his way including politics and the occasional world ending crisis this time the game is presented in full open world format compared toand s location based exploration the regions are a joy to ride around and explore and are full of nooks crannies and points of interest and sidequests to find as you do much of this is unmarked on the map so youre rewarded for straying off the path and looking for new things theres tons of sidequests to do an points of interest to find so if youre a completionist you can easily expect to get over a hundred to two hundred hours of content out of the game and expansions depending on how quickly you play and how completionist you want to be about it
the game is aesthetically beautiful to look at and in emotional cutscenes the animation work is superb capturing complex facial expressions and stances in close up views without feeling at all ike uncanny valley the music is understated for the most part as you wander around with specific moments recieving accompanying tracks combat music did geta little repetitive as i wandered around at times skellige especially is wonderful to roam around and the music there in comparison to novigrad and velen is relaxing and immersive
the games story centers on the hunt for geralts adopted daughter ciri and her connection to the wild hunt players of the previous games will recognize the wild hunt and a great deal of expansion is done on it in gamethings that are simply not mentioned and possibly werent conceived of yet in previous games so dont worry about feeling like you may have missed something other plot markers involve the continuance of the northern wars plot fromalong with the misadventures of geralts friends dandelion zoltan triss and more the games main plot is alrightthe wild hunt was cplot at best inandso seeing it take aplot status inpushing the interesting intrigue and politics to a back seat was disappointing for me as thats really why i likedand 
the gameplay loop is mostly unchanged from previous games the alchemy potion and bomb making mechanics as well as toxicity are unchanged for the most part youll find new recipes mix them up and replenish them with alcohol on meditation potions take up a toxicity meter which governs how many you can drink at once decoctions are much longer lasting potions that take up toxicity for long periods of time but do unique effects based on the monster parts that made them potions have been reduced in duration even more fromwhich was already less thanpotions are now shorter term combat buffs even more than witcheri used a mod that made them lengthier again i preferred this style from witchermelee combat is fast attacks and strong attacks as well as parries and ripostes and various buffs and level up skills will affect them and make them do more damage higher critical hits or on hit effects signs are useful on a utility levelnot so much on a damage level lighting things on fire knocking them over slowing them down these are the effects youll use signs for not the damage both the expansions improve signs a great deal for high level play
the level up system allows you to choose new skills in alchemy combat and sign trees as well as general perks that do miscellaneous untyped buffs these trees can be paired alongside mutagens which give greater bonuses if you match the tree they can fromcombat mutagens with combat skills sign mutagens with sign skills etc levelling up is slow at first but by mid and late game plot the game is throwing xp at you hand over fist and youll level up very quickly youll likely end the main campaign at about leveland places of power will also give you skill points
if i had cons its as follows i made the mistake of playing in normal mode which makes the game incredibly easy later on as you get better gear i should have played death march to keep the game a challenge all the way through the combat system is engaging but nothing incredibly deep mostly you can spam light attacks and quen to great effect bombs arent overly useful for damage but are good for status effects same for most signs another frustration for me was falling damageits very very high and geralt cant fall very far without instantly dying i think i died more to fall damage than anything the enemy assortment in the main non dlc game is not very much dogs ghouls werewolveslesser vamps they fight basically identically wraiths and flying wyverntype creatures formof your encounters and most monster contracts are just a juiced version of a basic enemy human enemies all fight identically regardless of faction or style
the cons are minor and dont detract from the game at all overall anyone with even a passing interest in the series any fan of open world rpgs or anyone looking for a big meaty game to sink a lot of time into would do very well to pick it up it wont steer you wrong"
"great game"
"game of the decade period"
"as far as open world rpgs go the witcheris one of if not the best one i have ever played the visuals are stunning most of the side quests are unique and engaging the story and the dialogue are top notch i am currently on my second playthrough and have only suffered glitches once or twice and they were only minor glitches fixed by reloading a quick save id easily recommend this game to anyone who likes fantasy rpgs"
"loved everything"
"the main story quest is the best part of the game and the quests are the most likable part of the gamethe secondary quests gave me unique experiences and i give it my best criticismthe capabilities of the game developers in story telling is excellenti was immerse in playing the secondary quests far beyond being goal orientedthe main story is goal oriented but that alone makes it the most important part of the gamecompared to the secondary quest the main quest has the best story lineyet the secondary quests made me lose track of time and i had no mindset of goalsi simple played the game when it came to the secondary quest and that is what allowed me to become immerse into the gamewhen i play the main story i want to stop playing the game and i want to go to the book store to buy a witcher novel
the open world on the other hand is very quite littlei have no desire to experience it and the only reason i go exploring is to gather herbsthe question marks on the map makes me go into the wilderness only to find anticlimactic materialsthe open world is object oriented and it is not exploringi feel like i have to complete objectives rather than experience an artificial worldwith this game i dont want to explore the open worldi know that my range is limited in the given kingdom in which im inthe open world has a limit to immersionthe times i am immerse in the open world i meet enemies that arelevels higher than geraltthis puts the game play at a disadvantage since it becomes statistically impossible to defeat the enemies yet geralt should be able to defeat every enemy in the game regardless of his levelsince he is a unique character to the story
the relics are extremely easy to find but i wish they would appear less frequentlyi want to have more options to crafting and i want more flexibility into magic pointsi dont want to spend more thanpoints to get to the fourth level of magici would rather spend five on the second level and five on the third to get to the fourth level of magic"

"some of your dumb idiot friends will say its badbut it isnt best game to play very fun its my favorite game of all time personal game of the decade"
"swords ncool"
"this game is way more fun to read and watch than it is to play
actually participating in the locomotion or combat tends to be an exercise in patience i found myself constantly fighting with the controls in order to accomplish really basic things like not falling off a ledge when trying to pick up an item combat is floaty and unrewarding at its bare level this game demands that you prepare for encounters like a monster hunter game while also presenting combat as the tense methodical combat of dark souls where you need to pay attention to enemy movements to avoid immediate death these ends of the game seem to completely undermine one another tense fights arent very tense when you can just throw a couple items with the same name as your enemy to make it x easier to kill and preparing isnt very engaging because its just throwing an item and moving on to normal combat its not terrible but its enough to prevent me from doing another playthrough
however almost every other thing this game has is really really good the story evolves gradually in a way that lets you get invested without feeling like youre being forced to care about characters in situations that dont really matter picking up a main or side quest actually feels engaging because of the performances that contextualize it almost all of the quests in this game is either a fetch quest or a quest where you go in a cave and kill the monsters normally this would get stale but the characters asking you to do this are interesting and convincing enough to keep you thoroughly motivated yeah the actual quests themselves are not particularly fun or engaging but i did every single side quest because of i wanted to know more about this character or the world they live in worldbuilding is also excellent throwing you into an interesting bit polish fiction that feel very distinctive even if it shares a lot with traditional european fantasy settings
this game is worth picking up if you are willing to experience a great story in spite of the fairly mediocre game that its attached to"

"when i first heard about this game from my friends that played this before they were highly recommending it and considered it one of the best games ever even tho i was sceptic i decided to give it a tryback then i have not known anything about the witcher series the storyline the background the lore itself all i knew were the very raw basics of the game a fantasy middle aged world with monsters and a monster slayer as a main character excellent graphics and convenient gameplay mechanics
after the firstminutes of gameplay i instantly came to realize its much more then some good looking monsterslaying i got immediatly sucked in to and i cant highlight this enough the strong story and plot the game was all about
i really tried my best to finish the story asap because i was so keen on knowing what will happen next in the game it really felt like like wathcing a movie or reading a good novel apart from a huge difference in this case i was the one deciding what will happen next it was too late when i realized that not only main characters but whole communities fate was deppendent of my decisions
and in my case this was the main feature of the game that made me so obsessed with it
ofc in the first playthrough i made all the bad decisions and after finishing the main story i felt heartbroken and empty it really got to me i decided to start exploring the whole world behind the witcher got a better view and image about the characters the background and the history that made up the witcher 
you can imagine how it felt to sit down again and restard the game from the beginning and playing it through slowly and precisely keeping attention to every little detail
it was amazing one of the best decisions of my life i got the best ending possible even played through all the dlcs which represent and entirely new game experience and finally felt completed
long story short i can only highly recommend playing this epic once in a lifetime giant rpg i promise you will not regret any second or cent spent on it"

this is without doubt the best game of the last decade and for the price you pay for all content it is an absolute recommendand probably not a bad way to kill time while waiting for cdprs next game cyberpunk"

the story is compelling is filled with easter eggs and a story line you influence by making political romantic and role play choices its an amazing game to grind and gather collectibles and better gear as well as craft up gear and customize your playstyle on deathmarch some of the bosses and missions are extremely challenging and to succeed you need to adjust the way you approach the game entirely differently other than being challenging and compelling both story wise and gameplay wise the game is absolutely stunning visually there are little to no bad things i could say about the game truly amazing"

of course the game has its flaws and some quite annoyingly so but they are easily overlooked by everything else that is offered every decision you make in the game whether it be in a main quest side quest or heck even with some random encounter has and impact and changes the dynamic of your story as you play along the witchertruly is a masterpiece and i applaud the entire team at cd projekt red for making such an admirable game"

"the witcheris an amazing game with some amazing gameplay comparable to skyrim one could say voice acting is top notch andof the time but its not seamless pauses between voices occur sometimes gameplay is satisfying but does leave a little to be desired quests are numerous and expansive sometimes being short and sweet or being long and adventure filled the story is long long and filled with fun quests and actions to take on monsters are scary at first but quickly become something to conquer and nothing but the game isnt hard if youre on normal so its fun for nonexpert gamers graphics are amazing the game is beautiful and environments are high in detail but expect to require a good computer to run everything the witcheris a fantastic game and i recommend all to play it for a fantastic time"

"hello im team burger in my playthrough i skipped a lot of the talking that i didnt think was important to the story then when the talking was over i went and i killed stuff i never used quen in my playthrough because im alpha as redacted i also did not craft any potions that were not essential to the quest i would recommend playing on blood and broken bones or death march the other difficulties were not challenging at all i used gourmet and facetanked the whole game so i guess it was my fault for playing on a low difficulty
the world itself ispeople look like people and not programmed bots the openworld is beautiful the weather effects are the best ive ever seen there were countless moments were i just stopped to admire the view the music also helped bring the world to life
i found myself yearning to explore every corner of the world however it didnt feel natural to stop during the main quest because why would i go boating in skellige no i wanted to save ciri but after the main quest it felt almost pointless and unrewarding
if you want a good story play the game and follow the main quest if you want to feel like a monster hunter in a world filled with evil avoid the story i would say the game doesnt do a good job allowing both
overallgreat game just wish i didnt feel so alone and bored after i finished the story"

"header witcher iii wild hunt is not a game its an experienceheader
clearly the best winner of the trilogy and totally deserved the goty of its releasing year
story the cast of the witcher iii has grown greatly since witcher ii and man was it a good call even the smallest characters still caught my interest and i couldnt help but pay attention to everything they said since they all had something interesting to say it is hard to think about the main story over the many and i mean many other tales in this release the monster hunting aspect of witcher that i loved so has been expanded with these contracts that you collect on these boards that hold flyers not every beast you run into needs to die sometimes you must decide if that is truly necessary but watch out some are going to try to trick you
the main story is another chase for a person you are looking for except this time around its someone very close to our hero and this is the most personal quest in the books for him along the way you will meet colourful characters that will lead the way but of course in the witcher world nothing happens for free so the majority of the story is doing favors so you can get info on where you must look for your important person luckily none of these stories are anywhere near bland

combat the combat of this game doesnt change too much from its predecessor except for minor improvements that make the combat feel better and the witcher signs all work a bit different
misc lots more loot this time around more armour more swords and ways to customize each a bit
gwent boy oh boy do i love gwent i usually hate card games for their complexity but gwent is your friend easy to learn and also easy to master against npcs atleast if you get into gwent you will be spending hours fighting every merchant and friend you find so you can get that one more card into your deck there are even a few side quests with gwent tourneys"

"this is in my opinion one of the greatest rpgs of all time its up there with baldurs gate and oblivion in terms of great storytelling and characters its based on a series of excellent books so you might argue it has an advantage on the story front but i would argue that cdpr added their own touch in all the right places to allow this game to stand apart from the source material the gameplay mechanics are excellent combat is fluid and the difficulty is fair no cheap shots the world is enormous and bursting with things to do rare items to find quests to complete and so on gwent is one of the best minigames i have ever seen if you havent played it yet youre missing out"
"awesome all of it"
"so much to do great game play interesting questing"

"honestly one of the best games ive ever played and ive played tons tons of different swords gear and locations the world is super wide and can run pretty smoothly even on a ti i love the fact that the game is challenging its not easy to level up and you have to make smart decisions such as where to put your ability points totally recommend this to everyone"
"great card game but i dont understand the monster hunting side quest"
"witcherthe wild hunt is one of the greatest rpgs in the past decade not since kotor ii or fallout new vegas have i enjoyed spending this much time in a game this is my second time playing through the game and my first time doing so on pc and im enjoying it more and more each time i jump back in it isnt perfect the combat is weak but enjoyable and the underlying systems that add onto that combat system can at times feel a bit tedious but if you allow yourself to really spend the time necessary to get accustomed to what the game throws your way youre guaranteed to have a phenomenal time also yennefer is the objectively best choice"
"what a game definately one of the best games i have ever played with hours and hours of story and loads of killing witcheris one of the best games out there everything from the story the characters the dlcs are absolutely amazing and if you havent played this game yet you are missing out the one negative thing i have to say about this game is the horses specifically roach what an absolutely awful animal who i wish i could kill on several occasions but are not allowed to"

side quests are actually interesting with choices having lingering affects that you may encounter later on in your playthrough the main story is compelling enough and your choices matter there too
the combat can be a bit clunky but once you get a handle on it and on player character movement it isnt too bad
the dlc is certainly worth the money if you enjoyed the base game and want to see more of your favorite characters with new and interesting ones on top
gwent a card minigame within the game is amazing collecting all the cards and participating in the high stakes tourney is good as well as rewarding in terms of crowns"

"pretty waw"
"similar to skyrim very story heavy choices matter has a bit of a detective vibe to it search for clues crafting and combat systems are a bit over designed but playable keep in mind you may need to roll back a few saves if you dont bring enough supplies into the dungeon to battle bosses the looting is pretty tight because your supposed to take a lot of to buy items from merchants instead"

"if you want to play a good game this is the one that will harden your nips like ice never have i ever witnessed such a beautiful work of art my feebleyear old mind could not comprihend the concept of perfection so i quickly deemed this game as boring as butts but now that i amand lonliness and self loathing has gripped my very being i can now fully understand how foolish i once was the only regret i have on this mortal plain is that i wastedyears of my life whoring and indulging in self destructive pleasures while i could be living my life bicuriously through a pixelated image that i have given value to itsi just took a hit from my bong my cat sleeps on my lap and i just plowed a wizard on a stuffed unicorn what a time to be alive"

"yes"
"super fun dudes"
"toss a coin to your witcher"
"i enjoy the game mostly for its story telling and world building but generally its pretty decent i will say for those getting into the game or looking to see whether its for them think a slightly janky watered down dark souls combat lots of rolling or sidestepping except the jankiness comes in the form of you may dodge towards an enemy instead of the direction you pressed that type of jankiness like they didnt finish beta testing and polishing the combat controls
outside of the combat jankiness its a fantastic game theres a couple tweaks that could be done less monsters that constantly heal to max in battle less constant armorweapon repairing would be nice or let me repair it myself a little easier admittedly onlyhours into the game but so far no easyinexpensive way to fix gear story telling is fantastic it feels like a living breathing world with a unique culture its like a prebuilt character version of morrowinds feel to be honest
i have a personal gripe about levels making it so that versus certain enemies i literally cannot win versus them no matter how good you are like for example a werewolf you can outplay for a literal eternity however if youre low level enough you dont do much damage which youd think would be fine except werewolves can heal to full unless you bring moon dust a relatively difficult thing to procure the ingredients and make multiple of so youre gonna run out before you kill the werewolf
for those of you like myself who hate tutorials please hold with it grit your teeth and ignore being talked down to and pandered to forminutes straight its a fantastic game once you finish the tutorials and the castle area it gets so much more fun
mainly outside of those minor critiques its a fantastic game built around story telling world building magic and its place in the world and playing a monster hunter"

geralt handles like a car and so any tactics have to be started about a halfsecond to a second before you need them he cant turn on the spot and when running he has so much momentum that i fear hell crash into a brick wall
but the story is great and the visuals are wonderful well worth picking this up cheap or on sale"

"tldr at bottom if u dont wantread aword essay following the college boards standards of an essay conforming to mla format lolllleeee xddd
its cases such as tw that i really wish steam offered a neutral option instead of the binary recommendednot recommended system
i rarely the type that lets popular appreciation for certain piece of media affect how excited i am for said form of entertainment however i be lying if i said i didn go into tw with high hopes ie heardread from multiple forums and sources both popular and underground that tw was easily the best rpg of all time and even several claims that it was easily the best game of all time so i guess you could say tw had some standards to hold up to
tws setup for the whole game spans well over an hour but over that time i had that gut feel that i wasnt really going to enjoy it it was over the hour mark that i truly had a deeper understanding of a game and understood that i was already going to get burnt out over the type of game it was having played both w and w as i had already played through the intro and could no longer refund the game i stubbornly decided to play throughout the entire game i guess i should state that ive always been extremely stubborndeterminedhellbent especially when it comes to my hobbies almost to the point where describing it as masochistic wouldnt really be a misdefinition doesn really help that i try to be as frugal as possible so you best believe i wanted to get my money worth as there was pretty much no turning back the clock and refunding i also got the goty edition so i have the dlc to look forward to
over the course of almost half a year i trudged through the game i didn really enjoy the experience per say merely tolerated it my main gripes with the game were the following the gameplaycombat the questsside quests the characters and the story with the main culprit being the gameplay
tw gameplay has barely evolved from the system put in place by tw a game with dated combat even bystandards witchercombat requires no thought is extremely basic requiring literally maybe likeinputsmax if running constant bombssigns and absolutely tedious as it barely changes for the entire god forsaken game maybe a special combatspell action even playing on death march the game hardest difficulty branded as nsane and only for the ost hardcore gamers the only time i died was employing stupid selfchallenges on myself in order to spice up the combat how late can i dodgeparry without taking damagehow many hits can i deal before getting hit etc etc as the main quality i value in a game is the enjoyment of gameplay i couldn enjoy almost a single thing about the gameplay tw has to offer also the final ending sequence with rampup and conclusion included was so thrillabsent i swear my heartrate didn even exceed likebpm but what can i expect from this games combat like honestly
for damage calculating the level scaling is absolutely dog sht if enemies arelevels over you it not the end of the world as they can just as easily be dispatched with the addition oforextra hits however as soon as enemies are likelevels above you the enemies take literally likeof your normal damage and their damage is amplified like xor evenshotting you fall damage is also extremely stupid falling likefeet results in a safety roll taking no damage fallfeet and you break both your legs leaving you athp fallfeet and it an instagib disabling the nemy scaling option in the settings menu that i was unfortunately made aware of only over half way into the game made it so every enemy i faced including rats and dogs wouldn tank likehits so that a plus
so onto the side quests i kid you not pretty muchof side quests followed this linear formulago to said locationhold rmb and follow trailinteract with itemenemies the otherwere scavenger hunts with the difficulty of a piece puzzle and quests so mundane i can even recall them
as for the main story il admit it was slightly interesting the story telling is pretty good for what it worth however the whole ordeal of getting to the good parts of the story telling basically feels like youe running around pointlessly doing the most mundane sht possible interacting with characters with very little depth that you know for a fact won even be mention outside of their questline unless they happen to be a supporting character of value which only likecharacters are in a sea of likeinteractions and as for the main supporting characters that you find yourself surrounded by through the course of the game almost none really struck a chord with me as they had barely been given the depth of a pothole and were even given aids personalities benevolently given by good ol cdpr
as a side note the inventorystorage was so poorly coded that storing any halfdecent amount of gear literally lags the game forseconds and evenseconds when stockpiling when moving literallyitem i just installed aweight limit mod to avoid that spaghetti code all together
so enough of defecating on the game il be one to admit that what the game does well it does astronomically well the music is amazing from combat themes shoutout silver for monsters adventuring themes shoutout the fields of ard skellig to tavern music and ambience shoutout back on the path another round for everyone a story you won believe and even the damn unreleased gwenttavern track the game atmosphere and environment are fantastic to the heavenly elven architecture to the slums of novigrad from the snowy peaks of ard skellig to the dark dank caves in velen the lore is very deep and ingrained in the world creds to andrzej sapkowski and feels so natural you could dive on wikis and forums for hours just reading up on it gwent a minicard game so unimportant to the overarching entirety of the entire game that you can completely ignore it was so interesting and fun it honestly better than the pw mainstream trash that is hearthstone the gwaficks were also pretty good but a far cry from being the opprettiest game of all time with mudded textures fromfeet away extremely mediocre parallaxing and florafauna ripped straight from a game fromhowever even with all these pros they unfortunately don even hold a candle to the focus of the main game and its flaws
tl drthe witcherabysmal gameplay repetitive formulaabiding quests and annoying characters all these negatives make up likeof the gamewere strongly outclassed by the games fantastic strong points environment music worldbuildingarchitecturelore resulting in a very interesting and engrossing game that plays like a pile of garbage from the s thats as fun as waiting in the dmv line
i honest to god had more fun writing this than playing the dull parts of the actual game"

"discovered this trilogy while looking to play a good single player game the first ones combat really put me off so i skipped to the second and was pleasantly surprised it felt entirely better than the previous one and the entirety of the content was very entertaining immediately became one of my favorite games of all time
after i finished the second with such appreciation i really wanted to see how the first one was outside the horrible combat so i went back and just modded shot kills onto it and then i could at least stand playing through it take away the fighting and the first one felt almost better than the second
at that point i had extremely high expectations for the third and was wondering if it could actually be any better lo and behold they knocked it out of the park with bases loaded
this game not only took all the great things about the first and second and implemented them perfectly but it also has everything you wished the firsthad mounting fast travel decoctionlike consumables treasure hunting etc and on top of all that they put it into an open world
i got lucky and was able to purchase the entire trilogy for onlyover the holiday sales which was already a score but now that ive played it i would gladly pay more than quadruple that ive gottenhours of gameplay from the third one alone and still have plenty more to do even the first ones had a lot of contenthours played between theof them this series has easily been the greatest value i have ever purchased
i cant even recall the few issues i had with the third game as im writing this because they are so minor you can count them withhand
so to conclude i highly recommend everyone experience this game if you can
the firstarent necessary to play the third at all but i would recommend it if you want a good long story
while playing these i discovered that theres also a witcher series on netflix that im going to watch once im done but this game just set the bar pretty high so im going into it with low expectations despite the praise for it"

"one of my personal favourite series in gaming top notch story telling game mechanics and world design is both amazing in detail but also are so linked to the characters and the story it makes the whole world feel real gameplay is challenging yet not frustrating and planning ahead for every mayor fight and then successfully coming out as the victor really does make you feel like a true bad this game has everything i as a adventure rpg fan desires even if these kinds of games are not your style still worth a try you do not necessarily need to play the firstgames to get into the story of this one although it is recommended that you do so that all the references and character backgrounds are clear a true masterpiece in my opinion"
"unlike most people it took me two years to finally get into the game once you get past the first region you can truly appreciate the amount of time and quality that went into creating a true masterpiece on ultra settings the environment is arguably the best in the genre it is a truly rewarding title with high sense of progression and an intuitive crafting system after not giving this game a chance and now finally getting into iti can say it is well worth your money and time"

"i have wanted to play the witcherwild hunt since its release inhowever i was always hesitant to start because i knew that i would not be able to stop it only took a few hours of gameplay for the witcherto turn into my newly discovered obsession i found myself waking up early on weekends to get an early start l only finish one quest tonight often extended to two or three and i starting doing something that i usually never do replaying quests to try different optionshours later noragrets and i finally ready to put my controller down what an experience never has a singleplayer game kept me interested for so long which speaks volumes about how immersive this game truly is cd projekt red set a very high standard for triple a games and a strong reputation for themselves
by far my favorite gaming experience of 
played with playstationcontroller
positive
for a game that isyears old the witcherreally looks amazing from the strands of geralt hair to the different landscapes and cities i especially loved toussaint to the weatherlighting you can really tell that a lot of time was spent to make this game feel as alive as possible i have never seen a game do the sunspots in your vision as well as this game has managed
the biggest selling points in my opinion are the characters and story telling without the magnificent writing and voice acting offered the witcherwould not have been such an immersive experience given how many characters are introduced in the series it amazing how many unique personalities there are literally none of the main characters are repetitive dull or lack personality there are countless quests and wonderful moments that i remember vividly and am very fond of for example when i received a drawing from a little girl i saved more impressively so you even feel a part of the game while in the overworld many npcs will interact with you as you as you walk by depending on the city and progression of the game they will either call you names spit at you or praise and greet you i especially liked that cats hiss at you witchers are mutants of sorts and animals dislike that
although this may sound contradictory it is also great that you are allowed to skip dialogue this is perfect for those who don care about the story but in my case it makes replaying quests to choose different options a more pleasant experience since i don have to wait through long cutscenes that i have already seen
there is so much content even in the base game alone which took me approximatelyhours to play through the world is so vast full of quests treasure hunts contracts and even fun easter eggs the skellege isles alone has overislands that you can explore individually my favorite discovery by far is when i found dead tyrion locked up in a cell to my surprise i even enjoyed playing gwent the card game introduced as a minigame initially i ignored gwent as a whole but once i learned how to play it it quickly became an addiction i remember spending two full weekends roaming around only to play gwent and collect new cards the fact that cd projekt red chose to release gwent as a separate game really goes to show how successful it is
i absolutely love that the dlcs introduced hearts of stone and blood and wine are fully worth their price both dlcs add more thanhours of gameplay just through the main quest lines alone but even more if you want to delve deeply into each highly recommend to do so i don want to give away too much but both main quests are spectacularly written new monsters and quests are introduced and in the case of blood and wine a whole new area new upgrades both to your character and weapons and the opportunity to have your own villa are added not to sound too biased but some of my favorite quests are included in blood and wine it is also a nice touch that the developers included a feature which allows you to start the game directly at the dlc start at levelwith average equipment but honestly i would recommend playing through the main game first as it will make the dlcs that much more special
conclusion
 exceptional
the witcheris a hell of an experience that will remain deeply engraved in my memory i mean there aren many games out there that allow you to have sex on top of a taxidermied unicorn i also cannot stress enough how much this game offers for a singleplayer experiencei could easily spend another delightfulhours on my current save file without replaying quests or starting a new gamehighly recommended

games fine playing on death march difficulty which is still pretty easy controls have been improved over launch but are still slightly wonky having keybinds for potions that have like a handful of charges but not for oils which need constant changing and reapplication is legit nonsense the sign system is dumb needing to select which sign you want to cast by pressing its keyor something and then casting it by pressing q instead of just casting the sign by pressing its button and freeing up q which is a prime real estate keybind for something more important
im usually ok in fps situations like fallout or we but aiming this crossbow makes me feel like i have a disability
leveling progression is trash not specifically in this game but in general half theicons i went to were low level and gave reduced xp half of them where too high level to do at the moment why make an open world game where everything is available from the start and then make the enemies too high level so the quest cant be done cant wait for leveling systems to just not be in rpgs anymore totally limiting system
everything else is good story is good combat feels fun and if you dodgerollattack in the perfect order in a group of mobs you feel fancy astoo many side thingies to do though i feel compelled to do them all but dont want to because theyre getting boring i literally went fromtoand gotnekkarer nests in a row lame

"the scope and depth of this game is borderline ridiculous this should be the standard for all content the story is amazing with enough quests and sideplots to keep you occupied for hundreds of hours if that wasnt enough the dlc is literally big enough to be a totally separate game but fits pretty seamlessly into the original cdpr carefully built upon the successes and failures of witcherandto create a complex yet balanced combat system but if that doesnt float your boat switch to story mode and youll still find weeks of play as you solve the mysteries that build the overarching plot didnt play the other games or read the books no worries recognizable characters are more like easter eggs to to those in the know while newcomers get plenty of exposition on who is important and who isnt
while there are quirks and flaws in the game engine that have become the stuff of memes such as roach spawning on top of houses etc they are easy to work around and rarely if at all detract from gameplay frequently you may just stop and stare at the beauty of a sunset or a storm tearing across the landscape as the game also features a complex natural weather and time system that serves little purpose other than to deepen the immersion of the player into the environment and storyline
i for one cannot wait to see what cdpr manages to create for a followup"

so now i started my current save based on my math im at the ish hour deep mark i started this save in december of 
they have added two expansions that i still havent touched
im level 
im roughly halfway through the game
im still covered in quests i need to do with more ive yet to pick up from bounty boards

the dialogue with the npcs are incredibly well craftedthe characters are beautifully fleshed out and you really feel a moral sense in the choices you makei have often sat a while and just pondered before making decisionswhat you do matterimmediately in the quest and also down the line
alliances forged now will matter later in the gamei am so engrossed in the world and the charactersthe soundtrack is fantastic the gameplay immersive beautiful graphics and a free world to roamit is afor mei can definitely recommend this

i never expectedi would love playing rpgs cause i was never fond of playing with swords and stuff

"tw improves upon the second game in every way combat is smooth challenging and incredibly satisfying if youve played dark souls or any of the recent assassins creed games then youll find it to be quite intuitive the story and plot for literally all quests in the game is top notch youre rarely ever doing just some fetch quest to get some boring item for some boring character everything has depth to it even the most insignificant seeming quests and characters youre faced with many choices throughout the game some have bigger impacts than others some you will see the outcome of your choice sooner some later much later but remember every choice matters now that by itself is what separates this from almost every other modern rpg of the last decade
also it has gwent gwent is addicting as 
ps make sure you play the entire game and do the dlcs they are worth every penny due to the content they add especially for the price you pay they could have asked you to pay a full game price for blood and wine because it is essentially another whole game supplementing the base game you will not regret the copious amounts of time youre about to spend playing through this game"

"this game does not get better it starts off fantastic and stays that way pretty much all the way through but if you dont like the gameplay personally know this it does not get better dont stick it out for the story when you could watch it else where
this game is perfectly fine and if it was a different kind of game i might even rate it high however if you like me are interested in this because its an action rpg with elements of progressive rpgs like tes or fable be warned this isnt what youre looking for
you need to be prepared to be geralt the witcher more than just a witcher or a fighter in this world geralt has a very specific style of fighting based around using a two handed weapon and using small spells as a backup you can if you can stand the combat long enough expand your arsenal but for the firstor so hours you might only be choosing between light or heavy armor as far as real customization
i would have enjoyed the story if the gameplay didnt drag me down and make it a slog to play thats not to say its bad gameplay only that its not for everyone and not enough people talk about that so i give you my warning that if you dont like the experience of the first few hours of game play do not stick it out and lose your refund window like i did if you dont like the gameplay be aware that it does not get better any time soon"

cons nitpicks
combat can be a little wonky sometimes and honestly may turn some off honestly feels ok for agame
typicalgame issues including some wonky movement by your character and characters in the background of conversations
story starts off a little slow for some myself included
backstory is needed to get full enjoyment out of all the characters that you meet your playable character geralt knows returning characters newer players may be lost about who they areeasy google search about the character or even full summaries about the lastgames
conversation options dont always exactly match what geralt say but is more accurate to what you pick then a game like falloutthat is a big offender of this
infinite waifu wars about the two main women you can pick
pros
unforgettable and different story
unforgettable characters
beautiful looking settings multiple open worlds with many intriguing points of interest
plot that gets you personally involved from your choices featuring multiple endings that change with your choices
 dlc packs that are actually worth their price woah both packs include new questlines that are better than standalone games
grim astone and setting extremely dark plot points
the soundtrack is so different and amazing look up witcher soundtrack right now and tell me it doesnt set a precedent for the game
rewarding combat that rewards you heavily for preparing for a fight
gear progression flows well and rewards exploring for diagrams of craftable weapons or powerful weapons themselves
multiple difficulties that are clear in what you should expect
infinity things to do including fistfighting for money horeraces hunting some pretty cool monsters and etc
character customization change geralts hairstylebeard style and armor which can be dyed
gwent a charming mix of poker and maybe magic the gathering extremely fun mini game nonetheless they made a standalone game specifically for this because of how popular in the main game it was
conclusion at the end of the last dlc that warms your heart and makes you happy for your character unless you get the bad ending
if youve read this far wow good job please do yourself and buy this game this game is worth the pricetag for goty edition in my honest opinion it won goty ingot a decent netflix adaptation and is praised by many to be one of if not the best game of all time for a reason i implore you please buy this game"

"the witcher series is a hard one to get in to for the first two games but this third installment does a good job of letting you play in the space as geralt without bogging you down with prequels you get an idea of what happened through interactions with othershundreds of hours isnt enough which is many more than what i would call worthy ofdollars and it continues"

"theres a reason why witcheris considered to be the game of the decade by many it has an amazing and wonderful world in which exploring is never unrewarded some decisions can have huge ramifications later down the line and combat is fast fluid and intense all cornerstones of an exceptional role playing game and witcherdefinitely ticks all the boxes that said there are some issues during myhours i encountered several bug and glitches though they were simple graphical problems at best and occassionally caused my character to behave as if indoors at worst the only egregious errors i know of are a rare crash during the griffin boss fight at the beginning of the game and another crash when diving for treasure in a certain location with a radeonxt graphics card which to my knowledge has yet to be solved when the game does work however it works beautifully to quote the art of war by sun tzu know your enemy and know yourself and you shall always prevail gameplay in witchervery much revolves around this philosophy to the point where im willing to make an argument that you spend more time preparing for certain fights than you do actually fighting said fights witchergets my full recommendation a perfect"

edit
while some of the bugs ive experienced are neargaming breaking and they make me almost regret the time ive put into the game for fear i wont be able to finish it properly without undue effort ive had dozens of hours of fun in this game and thus it remains recommended only a complete idiot doesnt recommend a game theyve spent dozens or hundreds of hours entertained enough by a game to continue playing"

"get good"
"one of the best games ive ever played and for a game to be this size and still have every part of it be amazing even the dlc is impressive the two very minor issues i have with the game is thatdespite there being a large variety of enemies and monsters it feels like some enemies are far too common and some are way too rare andit feels like despite the fact almost everyone is highly against the witchers a lot of people are just fine with geralt shoving past them and jumping on their tables but as i said these are very minor concerns and i recommend this game for anyone who likes open world games"

"some of the best storytelling dialogue and character development ive ever seen in an rpg and ive been playing them foryears game looks and plays like a movie yet the battle system skillsgear genetic mutations potions and sword poisons and choices in how to play geralt within the story is some of the best rpg thinking ever if youve read the books i have youll appreciate the details they stay true to in the game as well as how they manage to make the necessary changes and deviations seem part of the original story seamless immersive storyplaying
this game was given to me as a gift and i didnt know what to expect it knocked my socks off and i was genuinely excited like a kid to play it and see where it went just dont want it to end now but definitely looking forward to replaying many times a gem of a game i want to be a witcher"

"having been played this game once or twice back when it was released ini came back just to play it again after netflix released its prequel version i believe
well the netflix version and the wild hunt are basically tad bit similarboth being searching for ciri or geralt one way or another
i am writing the review as of janurayyet this game looks stunning even afteryearsi am using gtxand it gives me stablefps on ultra settingsthe game is well optimizedit has few minor bugs though but it shouldnt be a problematic one
cd projekt red completed revamped the third title of the game while the other two had their own tales to tellhowever its a bit different than the previous versioneg you had to brew potions of your own could meditate only on specific places which this game has done away with italso not to mention the infamous jump which you couldnt do back in those games just like the developers had done ityou can continue the story of the previousgames based on the decisions you made spoiler letho
overalli would recommend anyone who has yet to play the game do purchase it its cheaper on sale if you want so

"well well well now where do i start ive played this game overover the course of many account cause as im lazy to switch to another times and im still not satisfied completing it cause omg there are so many things to do this game is absolutly its got one beautiful graphics absolulty moving songs for battle long travels cause fast travel is for boring people good character build up and many more things this game can also be very addictive i have literally forgotten about my friendswork cause of this game cause i showed up afterdays and kept saying winds howling and now that the witcher series is out im dishing out hmmalong with that the fun thing about this game is that it always keeps you working either through making potions searching for places with power or random creature attacks or someone asking for help in the middle of the road so theres never a dull moment the main story of the game is well writtenexecuted in my opinion i have not played the orignal first two games but ive followed up with their stories the romantic choices are actually pretty intense as long as you dont skip dialogs it really makes you crack your head as to whom to choose never go both just dont greedy pigs the fighting mechanics are fun especially when you learn to combo the spells with your moves and fighting style ive not used parry a lot at all i just dodge the npc attacks also the game is quiet dull about killing specific enemies like noon wraiths so read the beastiary before making moves on a enemy you have to prepare for any encounters you cant just go dancing into the battle filed thinking youll wisk this off prince of persia or assassins creed style no you have to do the hard work of preparing now the dlcs they are amazing ive just recently bought them and they are good especially blood and wine i enjoyed that a lot as there are new enemies and more new things to explore i havent completed either dlc properly as ive not gotten to opportunity to play them more than once but they are worth every pennythey add a new experience to the game overall with new upgrades and so on i havent spoken about gwent much nor will i cause gwent is not for everybody especially those who only played uno i never understood the game in the beginning but thanks to youtube tutorials i picked up on it quickly i wont say much about gwent as thats a totally exclusive topic to talk about and you know why as its so much fun once you understand it overall fantastic game i wish there was multi player coop mod to do quests and some quest are really hard and you could always use a helping hand on those like killing dragons is really difficult compared to a griffin i wish there was a way to store things in chests that were univesably access able like the ender chests in minecraft would save me a lot of time instead of selling my items that all i got folks if you like it leave a comment mustve definatly missed a lot of stuff as you could really type a lot about this game any quirky comments with a dask of sarcasm are always welcome have a good one on this game"

"tried to get into this game multiple times but got bored and gave up on it every time
pros
 good graphics
 riding around on you horse in the big world feels great a few hours
 good voice acting
cons
 no mechanical depth to combat most systems can be ignored just dodge and hit them on the head
 crafting system is absurd for example you combine leather straps into a full piece of leather should be other way around
 gui is primarily for console so it feels like skyrim playing a bad port of a console game
 leveled loot is boring you switch gear almost every level which means you never get attached to your gear also absurd that a better sword should be harder to use
 the game world itself is boring if want to take a walk in the fields i can just go out my rl door
 everything tries to be so gritty instead it feels like a parody
 and finallyall the bland kill and fetchquest that made the game feel like a chore and just made me give up"

when it comes to the story graphics music and gameplay witchernearly excels at all of these
the only ones who complain about the combat are ones that are like but this aint meh dark souls combat
my only personal negative thing about the game is that you cant upgrade or stay with the default armor of geralt it is my personal favorite out of all the gears but this downside is more of a preference
with all the content it has this game is an example of what a game should be not some cash grab from a lot of you know controversial companies
should i wait for a sale
honestly whether you get it on sale or not the game is worth it thepositive review rate is by no means overhyping the game this is perhaps m game of the decade"

"one of the greatest games ive ever played sunkhours into the game by just exploring and doing side quests barely even touched the games massive story its amazing from just slaying monsters to crafting potions oils gear etc normal is however a lot easier than expected overly the top easy if anything id try a harder difficulty havent tried anything past normal but from what ive heard death march is a challenging playthrough that takes advantage of crafting in death march your potions and oils play an vital role and it is highly recommended that yall do craft and explore to find the diagrams the game is absolutely immersive and just draws you in the only downsides in my opinion is some of the dialogue and cut scenes are really awkward not awkward but certainly off the nd thing is the game looks astonishing but in certain cutscenes for example in the beginning youre required to inspect a dead man where his limbs are torn apart and what not and there some of the looks of the body seem really poor compared to the rest of the game that being said its by no means a turn off or game breaking thing and lastly the third thing is just the game itself its written beautifully and the game is fun to play and always draws you in and in my opinion is the worse part it sucks you in and all you wanna do is play but school or work comes in and its on the back of your mind always ill be sitting there and ill be like damn do i wanna go home and play the witcher the game is fantastically one of the best looking games ive ever seen even when the game came out inits a must play for anyone that loves open world games please comment down below of whats your favorite mechanic of the game mine personally is the vast crafting system and just how fluent the combat is dodge left dodge right yell ohand roll hoping you dont die and just coming back to cut the monster or human in half is always satisfying please if you havent picked this game up please do and give it a shot the amount of care and love from cd projekt red on this title is clearly seen and shown"

"started to repeat the process again now on pchours in and ive only returned to kaer morhen the story and rpg elements of the game are amazing ive been hooked from the start in every playthrough so far theres a few minor bugs but nothing major to complain about gwent is also highly addictive and adds plenty of hours to your playtime searching for all the cards and players in the world difficulty wise if youre an experienced rpg player you should probably play on death march as after a whilethe difficulty ingame shakes off once youve crafted the essentials and gotten use to the combat system"

"extremey fun there is so much to do in this game the world building also feels very fleshed out and everything is very established and believable within the lore the story is so immersive that even having the option of skipping dialogue i wouldnt just because i enjoyed every cutscene as if i was watching a movie the gameplay is also very solid and fun being able to weave spells and attacks with varying combos being more available as one levels honestly kept me entertained the entire time"

"very good game with a very good story i played this game not having played another witcher game and ill say it was a bit of an adjustment for me given my expectations which at the time were basically for it to be a darker more serious skyrim having played it i was very wrong about that but it still delivers very well on the story gameplay and graphics after getting used to the difficulty having not played games of this style before i loved it its easily one of my favorite games of all time if you take your time and explore all the nooks and crannies the game can easily takehours on your first lowdifficulty playthrough additionally thanks to its length if you go back to play it again you will find the story to be easily replayable and with three different endings to the main story youll have plenty on your todo list for hundreds of hours all that would be worthless however without great characters and a great story which it delvers on as well also the dlc storylines hearts of stone and blood and wine are amazing too and while the former of the two is not as good as the latter both are definitely worth picking up and if all that wasnt enough for you theres a game within the game gwent playing gwent and amassing your collection of cards is an unexpected pleasure i find in this game and while sometimes it may spoil the tone of the story eg a man just gets done telling geralt his son was violently murdered and geralt suggests a round of gwent it can sometimes lighten the mood and then the following game of cards adds another layer of challenge and fun to the game
additionally the recent netflix series puts this game back in the spotlight but i will caution that if you arent versed in the lore of the witcher and you want a spoilerfree show experience then while i think youre still missing out on a very good game ill say you may want to hold off on this game otherwise definitely pick up this game it is one of the best ever made"
"very good rpg i do not want to stop playing"
"great gameplay totally worth the moneybest if you buy game of the year edition with all dlc"
"in my topgames of all time the gameplay rpg system story character development the lore of the world and the people surrounding it make it feel real truly a one of a kind experience by the famous cd project red there is literally not a single thing that i can say bad about this game been playing for years on console and now that ive got it on pc its breathtaking so beautiful smoothhz almost k resolution textures the game engine runs the assets models and lighting like nothing ive seen before you can grasp every single little bit of detail from the rendering distance giving the game a fresh new look even now and especially on pc and if you love mods youre in for a treat psssshhhhh nexus mods"

"when a humble bard
graced a ride along
with geralt of rivia
along came this song

from when the white wolf fought
a silvertongued devil
his army of elves
at his hooves did they revel

they came after me
with masterful deceit
broke down my lute
and they kicked in my teeth

while the devil horns
minced our tender meat
and so cried the witcher
he can be bleat
toss a coin to your witcher
o valley of plenty
o valley of plenty
o
toss a coin to your witcher
o valley of plenty
at the edge of the world
fight the mighty horde
that bashes and breaks you
and brings you to mourn

he thrust every elf
far back on the shelf
high up on the mountain
from whence it came
he wiped out your pest
got kicked in his chest
he a friend of humanity
so give him the rest
that my epic tale
our champion prevailed
defeated the villain
now pour him some ale

toss a coin to your witcher
o valley of plenty
o valley of plenty
o
toss a coin to your witcher
and friend of humanity

toss a coin to your witcher
o valley of plenty
o valley of plenty
o
and friend of humanity

toss a coin to your witcher
o valley of plenty

toss a coin to your witcher
a friend of humanity"

"this game is without a doubt one of the best cinematic experiences i have ever played cinematic experiences this is more than a game this is an action comedy romance drama thriller and detective movie this is a game within a game gwent this is falling in love with a franchise that is worthy of sitting up there with the fantasy masterpieces of tolkiens world i am so happy that the franchise is getting huge media coverage with the recent tv series too if you read this and havent played witcheroror read the books i urge you to do so

i absolutely hate gwent though and shall praise cdprojektred till the end of my days for not making it mandatory at any point to complete the main story"
"amazing game in every aspect except roach mod fixed it though"
"amazing story fluid combat lots of choices"
"there are some difficulty issues where you can accidentally walk into a super high level area but overall this game is awesome it takes quite some time to level up but that makes it so you can keep playing the game for a long time things i dislike are that the game occasionally freezes and you are stuck listening to a synopsis every time you load the game i like the graphics the open world aspect and the fact that you have so many choices on how to go about things"
"this game is amazing and everyone should play it"
"this is likely the best game ever made endless hours of content dlc that actually justifies the price great character development your decisions actually matter builds can diversify so much you can play how you want the combat is super fun and you can approach it in different way alchemy oilsbombspotions decoctions magic that actually matters what enemy you use it on or just hack and slash away a massive world with so much to explore and discover tons or sweet gear andgalore i couldnt comprehend not loving this game theres just so much to love honestly the only truei think ive ever played even the graphics are just stunning music outstanding ive purchased this game on xbox as well as steam and id be happy to buy it again i almost feel bad for cyberpunkfor having to be the follow up from cd projekt red but hell if its half as good as the witcheritll be a great game alright enough shilling from me"

 intro
 pro and praise
truly an rpg you are a witcher and its a broad specter you live out this role
wide range of emotions you will experience in this product
the camera during cutscenes it dramatizes an other dull moment of stationary camera cutscene
leveling system is not grindy lvlrequires xp lvlxp its adds onlyextra xp per ten level i highly appreciate this becausemil xp till next level makes you lose the connection to it being special
most fights have meaning
 con and functions i miss
some oil bottles you put on your swords are similar to one another five of them have orange in them in different hues one mixes them up easily symbols or some other way to distinguish them would of been wanted
 comments
multiple references to old stories ex little red riding hood and snow white and the seven dwarfs or is it just me
how this game portrayed different races felt like a mix of racism but also a description of different personalities this mixed or back and forth for some reason this personalities part felt new to me anyone else

"played a little inand after coming back to this inafter watching the witcher series on netflix in a postzelda breath of the wild world i still absolutely love this game its such a well done game and the signs of life in recent expansion packs is another promising feature for the future you can tell when visiting towns how much effort was put in to the game including things that are easy to take for granted such as the side card game now a standalone app npc characters with life and a bustling world with a variety of quest types there is so much story in this game that its one you can comfortably play for hours and still feel like a small part of an immense world however im a bit taken back by the violence in this game and id like to see a way to step back the gore more in any future releases by allowing players to turn it off unlike breath of the wild this isnt a game id recommend to my animal loving and vegetarian wife or children and thats important as we approach a new decade where relationships are more equal as more people adopt digital games and entertainment beyond just the standard gaming nerd i get the realism intended with violence in a wartorn area and the story redeems itself with solid worldbuilding and moral compass points but stilli reach for the witcher series as an alternative to the game of thrones violence thats unnecessary to perpetuate to tell a great story please give us a witcherand keep up the good work ive got hours ahead of meand that is uniquely special for a game that is many years old"

"when i first played this game i approached i underestimated it got tons of recommendations andfor some reason that now i cannot truly understandleft it after playing a couple of hours i would say it starts a bit slow or at least felt like that to me but after you start doing some quests the story will trap you and keep you in the loop of just one more quest before going to sleep
if you like doing quests you will love this game you can spent hours and hours just on the secondary missions or you know playing gwent maybe after you might even consider doing the main story

"ive played this game on the p s but decided to play it again on a device that wasnt as loud as a jet engine even after knowing the plot and knowing what the characters would saydo its still a game to play over and over again especially with the dlc attempting to accomplist all the secondary quests and discovering all the locations was easily one of my favorite parts of the game if you want a good time for a long time this is the game for you"

"i highly recommend this game
im not even past the first part of the story yet
so much content and not in the sense of collecting impossible amounts of a thing its hidden treasure troves treasure hunts side quests that are interesting at times
for example i found a missing persons contract hunted down her body because the wolves ate her and dispatched the wolves but then the animals that laid dead lead me to a hidden shack which is also where i encountered two bears with red skulls above their names that was when panic ran its course as i had previously exhausted my food rations when dispatching the wolves there was a lot so i ran around the house because it was locked and found a cave entrance that is the right size for me but small for the bears and without even checking whats inside i ran in all the way in and thought i was safe but that was when i heard a growl and geralt said werewolf all calm like while im thinking about how im gonna get past the bears outside and that is when i reloaded to a checkpoint before i took the contract and went to level up"

"attacking enemies often isnt even worth itwith swords made of glass the repair cost will constantly drain your funds often completely
the leveling system belongs in an mmorpg not in a single player gamelow reward and extremely tedious
combat is hack and slashextremely simplistic with power attacks mostly useless
the range to interact with things is atrociousit doesnt matter how close geraltis its more where you point the camerakotor solved thisyears ago
the devs put candles and fireplaces in lootable areas to prevent players from looting quicklyenjoy watching asecond cutscene every time you try to loot a bookcase because theres a candle on the table
im not even going to get started on the atrocious crafting system"

"the wild hunt for the dialog option to play gwent"
"ive played this game for years one of the best triple a studios and games out there
only problem is that the combat is a little too simple
on the hardest difficulty you win any fight by casting quen then dodge attack dodge attack if you mess up cast quen again one way to sort of break this up is to spec almost exclusively into your signs but that just adds the extra step of spewing fire every so often you wont really face any challenge in this game
another combat issue is the inability to jump while in combat it leaves you in this weird situation where geralt gets stuck on everything that isnt completely flat while fighting"

its vast open world is one of the most beautiful open worlds ever the world is so detailed that you could spend hours immersed into it its also is full of activites which is breathtaking actually
the gameplay is also considerably well considering it has so many other strong plus points the sound and the voiceovers are to the point the soundtracks are one of my favourites"

"got hooked on the game the second i played itwould recommend watch out for bugs though"
"a game where the busy work does not feel like busy work where you can simply focus on the main quests and ignore anything else however as you play you become more and more invested in checking in to villages youve been to when quests arise you become concerned for the well being of folk you interact with and in the outlying villages you will be greeted by some very warmly in passing dialogue whereas in towns outside of skellige you might find yourself listening to a lot of people insulting or demeaning you
its main story is very very solid the quests flow brilliantly the dialogue is meaningful the characters are lovable questionable or despicable in equal measures
side quests feel like they could be another games main story and the monster hunts are interesting

"i no longer game hardcore as i did in younger days
but back then i often got a feeling of excitement and adventure when starting a new game becoming immersed in the story learning the games mechanics and various layouts or systems
to me half the fun of these games were the unknown or sense of variety and adventure few games ever continued to deliver on that after playing for more than an hour or so
my library is now stacked with games i barely and never play because they were not games that could deliver that wow this game is incredible feeling
for years i had lost that feeling even after trying a myriad of games over multiple genres
i just thought it was something i would never encounter again
until the witcher 
overhours i have now put into this and still think it is one of the best games ever created it was fun intelligent challenging sometimes very beautiful immersive and sometimes just plain aweinspiring i often would think holythey thought of that too the developers have created a masterpiece and im sure anyone who has played it would agree
it tops my list with the original civilization gta halflife cc back when they all were first released and playing them for the first time could put fallout vegas in the same league as well 
now i must get back to real life and my family
thanks for the great times geraltco i will be back"

i just wish i could forget this game so i could play it all over again experience it from start to finish as fresh as possible
 this is true perfection the base game alone offershours of gameplay if youre strictly only following the main quests the side quests contribute something fearsome to it i have yet to play the dlc gifted to me by a friend for xmas

best rpg i have ever played any game made ever should use this game as a comparison as it sets the bar high
most beautiful and fantasy like world and graphics even without mods the color palette they used is simply phenomenal inthe game still puts other games graphics to shame
the characters are so insanely diverse it with almost no cookie cutter bullcrap and thats saying alot considering how most games are these days
the maindlcs are actually both amazing and the second one blood and wine is simply the best dlc i have ever played in my entire life
the modding community is amazing and has some really awesome mods you can use to make some of the games more heavy rpg elements less tedious and make the game look like it came out ingraphic wise
geralt of rivia is so damn awesome and relatable in alot of ways i have never loved a protagonist more you really can decide to be a good person or a bad one almost all the time which makes it a true rpg in my eyes
sorry that waspoints wasnt it couldnt help myself its that good p

"how do you like that silver"
"alright look the witcheris probably my favorite game of all time however the controls are clunky and somewhat feel off it is hard to describe but anyone who can pick up a controller or keyboard and mouse will realize that fairly fast also the roach if you dont know the witcher geraltsthe main characterhorses are called roach is very buggy and it is impossible to ride her without bumping into fences and trees every ten seconds if you are trying to traverse dense territory the horse is not skyrim level buggy but it is still frustrating in addition a lot of the main story feels like fetch quests only admittedly much more interesting than your average assassins creed fetch quests and the overall layout is very basic if you were to put it on a board
so why then is the witchermy favorite game of all time even though i easily just spent a paragraph listing its flaws because these flaws are so negligible that for me they really do not affect the game at all the story is immersive although it is very basic the emotional connections you make with the characters are there and significant even if you never even played the other games or read the books which you should do by the way those are also great or even if you just met that character and will never meet them again even some of the monsters have their own distinct characterizations and personalities and you will feel sympathy and compassion even for those monsters or you wont it is an rpg after all so what you feel is up to you the game feels more than a game it feels like an entire world that is working inside of your computer the trees are lush the landscapes are beautiful the cities especially novigrad are populated and carry a distinct eastern european medieval mood with each city and territory actually serving you ingame as you would expect from its reputation novigrad is your main hub for trading and economics while the velen swamps will hold many monsters for your hunting pleasure and alchemy material gathering further each one of these cities and territories is incredibly beautiful in its own way the sprawling streets of novigrad feel like an urban safeheaven on the surface but dangerous as you dig deeper the swamps of velen convey a dreary atmosphere and the skellige isles hold a special sense of freedom and lawlessness other than the environment of the game itself the mechanics are also satisfying as you play the game you level up according to what attributes you want to focus on in a welldesigned skill tree as you play the game you learn new techniques to hunt monsters and approach different enemies you even start to feel like a monster hunter that is essentially what a witcher is a mutant monster hunter yourself as you can identify monsters based on their tracks and crime scenes before you even learn what they actually are the mechanics engulf you and as you learn them you get further sucked into the world of the witcher 
this game is not my favorite game because it is without its flaws but because even after criticizing it i still believe it came out completely unscathed
 this game really makes you feel like a goat retriever"
"best game ever made also
gwent"
"best game ever"
"very hot peed white so many times playing this game"
"wow"
"a masterpiece in every sense of the word its reputation speaks for itself who needs to read a review get it play it get lost in it
also up for a round of gwent"
"best rpg"
"great game graphics are pretty good at base and can be turned up a lot story is amazing with a fair amount of choice for the player in playing most quests tons of side missions and and witcher quests if you want to take a break from the main story dlcs are fantastic as well especially blood and wine huge open world filled with points and characters most of which can be interacted with really a world that you can dissapear into amazing depth of detail honestly probably the best game ive ever playedwould play again and am currently playing again"
"game good yes"
"gameplaywise its not even that great but who plays witcher games for the combat that being said the game world is really massive with tons of stuff to explore and almost every location in the game is really well detailed from house interiors to wilderness writing is excellent and so is the artistic implementation both visually and musically heck sometimes when im in combat i pause the game just to listen to that sweet combat music ost"
"st time playing the game oops itshours later"
"white orchard is a pretty dope area hopefully the rest of the game is as enjoyable"
"the only thing in this game that i even have a mild complaint about is horse riding when not on a trail can be tiresome"
"its just a really good game if you prefer solo rpgs"
"amazing storyline great quests long game and definitely worth the money"
"must buy"
"best game of"
"do not buy this game this game has ruined every other rpg or open world game i have played my expectations are too high for games now this game is so great and it came out in"
"the perfect game or as close as it gets"
"well my experience with the witcher has been dubious before this game i played assassins creed odyssey and i was blown away by how good it was maybe because of this the witcherwasnt as good as i thought it would be below are some things i got bothered with during gameplay
 the character is easily obstructed by anything its difficult to move through objects and often i would get stuck between a chair and a table for instance
 the abilities are very limited and the points you get to acquire them are few which means you dont get to have many abilities as one would like to basically you have to choose from the beginning if you want to focus on sign simple spellswarrior or alchemy you cant have advances abilities in all three
 too much dialogue sometimes it felt more like a movie than a game due to so much dialogue all the time no quest was simple and straightforward which sucks because a game should have more action than just story after story
i dont regret buying and playing it but i believe those points could have been better
i definetely think assassins creed is much superior while keeping a gripping storyline without losing action and interaction in the gameplay"

"i have bought played and completedof this game on ps when it came out oni didnt have a pc setup at the time only a laptop that could barely run the game it was the best gaming experience of the decade for me here i amyears later after watching that fabulous tv show by netflix and got me wondering damn witcherreally was something i gotta play that again that same day i opened steam it was on winter sale and i didnt even think twice i bought it played it and now am again experiencing a great game all over again and feels so fresh somehow you can just make a totally different playthrough and make different choices even if this game was full price i would buy it again just for pc and i would definitly recommend you to play it if you have a good enough rig to run it game of the decade for me"
"most amazing game in a decade make sure to buy the dlc its awesome"
"this is a game which i played when it first came out on the xboxi couldnt stand it but now after purchasing it on steam hoping to fall in love with it on pc like i never did on console i can officially say i love it the controls i find are alot smoother and more comfortable on my pc not to mention the massive graphics upgrade that my console just couldnt handle if youre in two minds about getting this game then just go for it its a beautiful open world with rpg elements but not too heavy as to alienate players unfamiliar with this style of game highly recommend"

"best game this decade"
"introducing me into a fetched out world with plenty of things to do and a seemingly good main story note i didnt play the witcherorso i wasnt sure what to expect but and medival rpg everything seemed fine during actand actsince even the secondary quests where fetched out besides a few that didnt even work properly but after reaching actand learning more about the world of the witcher it seemed more like i was playing a mod for the base game from some atheist redditor im saying it because there is always an underlying theme many quests could have been avoided and where a pointless waste of timewith no additional story given and no secrets to be found while others wherent fetched out even nearly enough at least story and quest wise this was a waste of potential and i felt likeat least in theactthat the game designer didnt yet know if he was going for an destiny like rpg the map design itself was detailed and overall well done but there where many crates barrels and other stuff that was clipped into each otherand that was a frequent mistake another point of wasted potential was the visibility of the surroundingssince the character is in the middle of the screentaking up a great dealand the camera movement didnt allow for much visibility besides the essentials you wherent able to enjoy the map for long besides that everything felt sort of out of place and proportion objects close seemed closer then they wherewhile objects at a distance seemed further away the movement itself seemed forced and didnt allow much precision and freedomprobably to make it look more realistic but failing because of bugs ai and map design"
"one of the greatest games i have ever played story is fantastic gameplay is smooth and everything else is greatwould recommend"

"i waited a couple of years to try this game what a mistake this game is really up to the hype it generates it is not without flaws but no gamer is without flaws it starts slow and frankly boring but it paces up and it become an epic adventure in this very well crafted world with its lore and legends"
"no comment needed just look at the other amazing reviews it is so fun and immersive and has the most replayability of any fixed character rpg i have played"

"would run again in a bandit camp and spam aard with piercing cold"
"i beat this game on death march on the ps it was an incredible game and of coursethe experience is nothing different on the pc version that i have played this is one of the best games ever made with a massive world to explore there are dialogue trees a massive amount of potions that can provide different abilities various weapons that can degrade and you can enhance a huge varied list of enemies you will encounter and many deep enrichingside quests it is all wrapped into a good story andone that can currently be seen on netflixthe show though is more based on the books any case i highly recommend this game i rarely go back to play a game i beat twice but this one of the few i plan on dabbling back into time to time"
"better than skyrim"
"yeah"
"honestly ive tried to get into this game a few times now lost interest three times but im finally hooked
ive played the first two all the way through but this one is a fantastic end to the story

""
"it is bourbon biscuit as the westerners say"
"ignore the circlejerk and anticirclejerk crew thatll tell you this is the best or worst game in the universe
what it is is a great piece of work its massively expansive my first playthrough didnt play through steam took mehours and that was before dlc arrived the lore is fantastic and if you enjoy a mild rpg the choices arent massive in regards to good or bad but theres a lot of choice on how to handle a lot of the main quests that will suck you in for hours this is the game for you on top of this the game is fantastically optimised and ran extremely well on my pc back inbut even better now on my new pc looks amazing too
its regularly on sale forwith both dlcs which are just as worth it so you cant really go wrong the biggest and best advice i have for anyone starting is to spam the dodge button until you see an opportunity lots of people get caught up failing at the combat early because they try to spam down their opponent but its all about playing smart and waiting for the right moment theres even a little joke about it in the beginning of the game
most of all enjoy"
"if youre fine playing this with a gamepad then i recommend this but to me this is not a pc game which i expect when im buying a game on pc
in combat your mouse has almost no reason to exist with the right settings you could probably even play the game without it this game might be really good but am i buying a pc game then i expect pc controls and this feels far from it
this issue would drive me nuts to deal with through the entire game and i did search but found no mods or other fix to help with this
in the end this has left me frustrated and sad that such a great game can feel so awful on pc also if you disagree or have any information about this feel free to comment"
"top notch"
"trissyen"
"game of the decade"
"great game good story love it"
"go play it you wont regret it"
"the game is really just a movie honestly it looks great great characters and lore but beyond that the gameplay is pretty bad combat is very clunky dodging and rolling from attacks is inconsistent for a game that has you fighting enemies the entire game and it just makes playing really crappybecause you really only havemoves like light heavy signs and special moves you really dont even need to use heavy attacks because they just leave you open for attacks and you will rarely need to use signs because you can just hop around the enemy and that isreally all you can do because if you try to stop doing something while in combat youll just get hit because of how bad the block system is if you stop blocking for a moment then try to block again the game takes a second for it to register that you are blocking resulting in you getting hit or dying and forof attacks in the game blocking can stun you so its just better trying to dodge attacks than trying to block or parry and dont use automatic slomo kills in group fights because you still can get hit anywaybut in in order to not make this reviewpages long on how unpolished the combat in the game is if you are looking for a smooth combatfighting game like you see in trailers this is not it but if you are just interested in moviesbooksseries go ahead and have fun dont fall into the hype trap"

"hmm
how you like that positive review you filth"
"id bought this game because of all the good reviews id heard now ive started the second book finished the netflix series and am going strong at my first play through stillim playing on death march hardest difficulty the world witcher immerses you in is absolutely brilliant nothing is impossible there is no race or creature that does not exist this fantasy world is done so marvelously you almost forget its not real each character quest city land book creature everything has great depth and detail and makes sure you make use of all the tools at your disposal not only that but even the quest never truly feel the same as most rpg games nowadays eventually do youre always encountering or hunting different monsters sure but each one has its own story that just hooks you further into the game side quest are actually fun and the main story thus far has been amazing the pace feels nice its very interesting geralt is an absolute beast and as i said before it just does a fantastic job at taking you into the world of witcher because even though it does have all the generic fantasy monsters such as werewolves vampires trolls you get the picture it has many of its own monsters and places each of them in them same world beautifully the level of immense depth put into the lore and world everything is done wonderfully recommend it to anyone looking to play a new rpg or game in general if youre new to rpg give this one a try"
"greath story line
rich gameplay
huge world
best rpg ever for me"
"hmm"
"toss a coin to your witcher"
"the witcherwild hunt is truly one of the best games i have played the gameplay is believe is still unique regarding the combat system the game is extremely well polished meaning that i have not experienced many bugs at all with the fair amount of playtime i have
when i initially bought the game i had not played any of the other witcher games or read the books but the story was well explained and clear which i quickly grabbed on to the story itself was so immersive that i found myself playing long into the night just to find out what was going to happen next the game is also pretty long spanning aroundhours if you just rush the story but with all the other side quests monster contracts and guent games its probably aroundhours long so there is plenty to do once you have finished the main story
when the games main story finally ended i grew sad that there was to be no more of it this showed just how much i loved this game concerning gameplay such as combat even at the lowest levels the game is challenging but once you go up to death march difficulty the game is extremely hard comparatively to a souls game also the main protagonist the legend himself geralt of rivia is one of my favourite characters in a game hes serious humorous and romantic all at the same time the witcher world is extremely beautiful places like the skellige isles toussaint kaer morhen and the cities such as novigrad oxenfurt and beauclair are truly magnificent
i would also recommend the two main dlc for this game being blood and wine and hearts of stone blood and wine being my personal favourite adds an entire new area to the map this being the extremely pretty toussaint the boss fights enemies and main characters in this dlc are extremely well done and the story itself spans abouthours
in conclusion i highly recommend this game to anyone who is interested in fantasy style games it will go down in game history as one of the best ever and one of if not my favourite game of all time"
"overhyped and boring just like i expected"
"incredible game played forhours and still only levelgraphics and lighting are amazing and the story is the best ive ever seen gameplay is so smooth with little to no faults at all"

"one of the best games ever"
"amazing game indeed"
"even now that we have hitand this game will haveyears under its belt it is still one of the most satisfying games i have ever played first of all the visuals are still great and places like kaer morhen still suprise me how great it looks the gameplay is fun but once you figure it out it can get a little stale but still at points gives you a challenge at higher difficulties
all in all i will say if you like big roleplaying rpgs then this game is for you withhours of story not counting the dlc it is a pleasure to play all the way through even multiple times to get different endings"

"roach is 
thats the cons of this game"
"content is unbelievably massive
 its open world is one of the best if not the best
 decent story and likable characters
never thought id love it this much because im not really a fan of wrpgs but i now understand the hype that surrounds this game"
"a sweeping story about love life fatherhood and slaying monsters witcheris a high contender for game of the decade it has some of that skyrimlike nuance to it a fullybuilt world which you can explore and discover as much or as little as you like as well as almost literally endless sidequests to keep you occupied ive played the game through a total of once and ive sunkhours into it already definitely worth the purchase especially if on sale
the two dlcs are also very good fully fleshed out stories in their own right i found hearts of stone a little harder to get through but blood and wine especially with the new location touissant is definitely a winner"
"hmm"
"great game if u havent alredy give it a try realy no need to explain especialy now after few years of existance"
"while the graphics and story are spot on the gameplay itself can be frustrating at times the movement mechanic has a sluggish feel to it where geralt stumbles often when attempting to change directions while sprinting load times are incredibly long which makes dying a pain in theas you have to wait pastseconds of loading just to get back to your previous save"

"what an fantastic game i had never find a game alike spend a whole night exploring new stuff and finding out how to get the best gears possible slashing monsters all around the maps merciless run away with your horse if you couldnt beat the monsters stealing food and goods from the village completing quests and helping people thus you can level up with the roleplaying game genre of this game you can literally be who you really are either acting like a jerk to people or being really nice to people it affects your progress and all greedy for golds or being generous its all your choice there are more fun things you can do in this game
very recommended game to purchase

the story graphics voice acting side quests are amazing second to none that being said the only problem i had was a massive game ending decision is random and youd never spot it
outside of that the combat is by far the most frustratingly bad designed combat ive ever seen check my achievements i finished the game on death march rarely using anything other then food to regen health its boring clunky repetitive and just plain crap
if you can get past the the giant crapfest that is the combat the story is amazing the side quests alone are worth it like i said some of the impacting choices are stupid its done to show the witcher is a lesser of two evils kinda guy its pretty much the bases for the whole game but it really shows up in some of the choices"

final verdict
the witcherwild hunt is there anything bad to say about this game no not really cdpr put a lot of work into this game to make it the complete masterpiece it is this series spans over several amazing books and i think that cdpr did them complete justice
the gameplay here is phenomenal at the very least the way you travel really causes you to wander off very often and really promotes exploring the fightingcontrol scheme of this game works very well and i think many other developers of this type of game should take note the mechanics could be explained a tad more but they are easy to figure out
the visuals here were absolutely perfect for when this game released however today in nowi do think could use some work however there are many different options for modifications that are easy to do to solve this problem
you can really form this game to many players by adjusting the difficulty from super easy to making dark souls look like a piece of cake along with those things depending on how much of a completionist you are you could easily puthours into this game without really even noticing it there is so much content here to explore and none of it seems mundane gwent is a blast to play and side missions all have a good sense of depth to them
just to touch on bugs and glitches its hilarious when roach spawns on the roof of a house and super frustrating when you cant interact or pick up an object due to small tolerances
allinall this game is aespecially when you factor in that it is on sale all the time i think i spenton the game w all the dlc and generally i consider a game to be worth it if you get a hour of fun for every dollar you spend which this game did much more than that"
"yes"
"best game"

"the story so awesome"
"great story and gameplay is smooth fighting a little hard to get at first"
"great game"
"came back after the witcher series"
"hmm"
"the witcherwild hunt is a pretty good game be warned that the game tends to drag in the story and might not live up to the monstrous hype that it has garnered over the years"
"this game is a rpg with a huge and beautiful open world to explore there are a ton of sidequests with their own unique story for you to immerse yourself in the main quest keeps you on your toes making you want to see what will happen next if you need to buy gear you can complete contracts which will award you for your hard work and some of the monsters are so fun to fight
every character brings life to this already rich filled story not only the main ones but also every other character whether that be someone that gives you a contract or even a peasant doing is everyday life on the street
yet i spent overhours trying to beat a tournament of gwent and everytime i reach a new settlement the first thing i do is look for everyone that i can play cards with to get new ones i dont like to play card games and yet at every chance i get i always play gwent i have no idea how it happened i just know that it did"

"winds howling"
"yennefers hooha smells of lilac and gooseberrieswould sniff again"
"fantastic story and even better side quests most contracts felt like that one quest you always remember years later from an rpg
combat is a little simplistic and can be too easy on lower difficulties i recommend playing on death march to get the most out of the enemy variety and the myriad of tools available to deal with them
dlc is well worth the price with special mention to blood and wine being a vibrant and refreshing change of scenery while being packed full of content if you enjoy the base game you will likely appreciate this too"

"while my hours may be low through steam i assure you that if you have not purchased this game yet almostyears of it being released what are you waiting for this game is a masterpiece that is deserving of everyones attention the sidequests feel like their own stories and you can see the attention to detail throughout the whole game and not just the main story when you fight a new monster for the first time to the many other times you will fight that same monster there is just something about the game that never seizes to stop amusing me the dlcs are some of the best that i have played in recent memory and this game sets the bar where every triple a developer should be but sadly dont if you have been thinking about picking this game up but are afraid because you didnt play any of the previous in the series dont be alarmed neither have i and it never hindered me from enjoying my time i havehours on my ps version of the title and i plan on replaying it on here

"i dont recommend this game but if you want to play it
 install some mods in particular the hd reworked mod for higher quality textures the aqua mod and the high quality faces mod youll find all these and more at nexusmods
 consult guides as to what you have to do in order to avoid the bad ending anyone acting compassionately and responsibly has a high chance to run into the bad ending
the game has a lot going for it space restriction prevent me from listing the pros but the big cons points are
a formulaic quests
b boring combat
c unsatisfactory dialogue system and cutscene heavy
d playing on the minimap syndrome
e control issues
f ending selected based on a hidden judgement of player choices which cannot be called anything less than idiotic
a if you love walking around in medieval towns andor love the genre you may never get enough of the game but for everyone else the quests become repetitive as there are only a limited number of templates that are replayed over and over again with changing text but otherwise identical mechanics even focusing on the main quests becomes boring after a while
the latest assassins creed and tomb raider games and the witcherare pretty much the same game with different content the overall design quest and inventory management weapons and abilitytree management etc is pretty much identical this design makes most sense in assassins creed because the narrative has a simulation underpinning in the other games including the witchera lot of the control is not integrated into the world thus taking one out of immersion
b very simple tactics suffice to win fights so combat mostly is not a question whether one wins but only when i dont get why game designers feel that grinding an enemy to defeat is fun repetitively going through the motions of some fighting mechanics as dictated by the enemy is at most a chance to display endurance or commitment it isnt really fun in itself the challenge if present which is rare is figuring out the game idiosyncrasies for that particular enemy as opposed to cleverly using intuitive controls one example is fist fighting which is incredibly hard at higher levels but becomes trivial once one figures out the correct way to dodge there are multiple ways to avoid punches but only one of them is considered to be correct at the standard level being clever with potions etc does not pay off standard read boring button mashing works just as well there is considerably lag which makes it pointless trying to be be more sophisticated using parrying etc
as usual managing weapons is mainly a chore as one does not need enemyspecific weapons i found useful weapons early on which meant that i new weapons only meant that i needed to find a place to get rid of them and ii the legendary and priceless sword i received as a reward in a quest turned out to be lower quality than what i already got one loots and finds a ton of diagrams for weapon construction but never ever were any of these helpful for me
c most of the dialogue choices only offer ways to prolong the dialogue receiving more exposition andor background information as opposed to keep it as short as possible one can rarely influence the outcome of a dialogue some choices are misleading in that they suggest for instance a mellow response while geralt will actually still deliver some dck remark the dialogue mechanics feel clunky as they are reminiscent of s computer menu systems
there is an overreliance on cutscenes for exposition and dramatisation of encounters these scenes can drag on extensively and are even annoying to skip through after reloading a snapshot because of the high number of individual sequences one has to skip through sequentially at times playing the game feels like watching a movie
d one often has to use the minimap for navigational purposes instead of taking in the great scenery on the main display one is focused on a small map display slavishly following an outlined path of course one could turn the minimap off but the game is simply not designed to be played without the main aids that i destroy immersion and ii reduce the challenges to pretty boring activities there is one part in the game where the minimap is not helpful and one is supposed to find a path oneself since the task was manageable which it normally isnt it was actually fun to do the path finding i dont object to navigational aids but most of the game challenges should be manageable without artificial aids that take away from immersion
e some of the key bindings cannot be changed which forces one to change mouse controller mappings instead of simply changing the ingame key bindings
worse the e key is overloaded with actions it is used for igniting candlesfiresetc looting fast travelling mounting the horse talking and so on this means one will inevitably run into situations when one will loot a box next to a fast travel post instead of activating fast travelling mount the horse instead of talking to someone etc
looting itself can be extremely frustrating because sometimes geralt has to maintain a very specific distance and angle to a lootable item in order to activate the looting option it can sometimes take quite some time until one has positioned geralt in a way that one can eventually loot something this makes absolutely no sense if there is only one lootable item in the vicinity but a pretty frequent source of frustration
the horse is also a pain to use as it often gets stuck somewhere and cannot even jump over the tiniest of fences it also takes a long time to approach geralt after being called which forced me to either run towards it or just forgo using it as running a certain distance can be faster than waiting for the horse to arrive mount it and then clumsily navigate it over bridges etc
one cannot access the inventory page while shopping which means that if one discovers that one wants to sell or dismantle something geralt is wearing one is in for a very tedious exit shop dialogue enter inventory exit inventory enter shop dialogue again cycle this is most annoying
f there are five choices that influence the ending of the game one has to get three of them right ie choose them according to what the game designers felt made one worthy of avoiding a very frustrating ending the problem is that a compassionate and responsible player will easily only get two right thats because out of the other three two are not defensible at all and one is very debatable in one of the choices the player is supposed to support a childish destructive action which is a kneejerk reaction based on bad evidence it turns out that the little circumstantial evidence there is pointed to the wrong direction so anyone making the wrong choice from the endings perspective is subsequently validated by the game in terms of the factual decision but penalised with respect to the ending the other two significant choices are pretty much equally problematic as the theme is that one has to pander to
as opposed to

i like the fact that there are a lot of shades of grey when it comes to moral in the game and i like that some of the decisions not necessarily have the intended outcome this makes the game realistic and interesting however it is simply unacceptable to deny the player a wellearned pay off at the end due to some idiotic ending selection mechanics i got a good ending because i came across a discussion that alerted me to the problematic mechanics when i tried to find out whether a decision i made was relevant for the games progress i would have been livid if i had run into the trap set by the game designers"

this game does not need any mods besides graphical mods that is if you want to do that imo i think it looks great without shaders and all that this is simply a good game and if you are already here reading the reviews then smile to yourself knowing this is a good game purchase

"the final instalment in geralt ofrivias story had a lot to live up to with partsandbeing massive fan favourites and receiving a plethora of game awards whileandwere both on a rail games that heavily focused on the story of the witcher parthas made the brave choice to be an open world instalment and wow does it do it deliver the graphics are stunning the world is not only vast but vibrant and filled with character and activities
the combat system has had some tweaks in this instalment and most of them are improvements i feel like the targets arent quite as predictable as in w and the targeting system has been vastly improved the only drawbacks for me are the removal of the fast attack and the camera shakeenemy hit reaction that made you really feel like you were in the battle while these attributes did make you feel like a god in w i still prefer the combat in w more
finally the improvements to weapons and armour the amount of combinations in w were very limited and you were always left wanting when finding a new upgrade to move to but in w the options are vast along with a whole host of standard base armours you also have witcher school armour to collect that gives you some crazy bonus stats upon set completion
on the whole the witcheris a well put together game with a massive amount of endgame possibilities and quests the only complaint i have is that the story doesnt quite feel as involving as the first and second instalments and some of the mission problem solving elements involve basically walking around a party looking for a person that always seems to be the last person you arrive at or searching multiple barrels or boxes for an item that again seems to be in the last one you look in if youre going to make a puzzle make it actually challenging dont just make it about us watching the same cut scenetimes while geralt taps a barrel and says hmm seems full
that being said the game is really satisfying to play on the whole and the expansion packs add a literal ton of new content ive pumped a few hundred hours into this game and ive still got a fair amount of content to go get the goty edition when its on sale its probably the most hours ive put into a single player game since final fantasy 
 out of"
"wow such an amazingly epic actionrpg the game is huge my advice is take your time go out and explore every question mark on the map there are tonnes of side quests main story quests and additional dlc quests to be done if you see this on sale then buy it you wont be disappointed the graphics are absolutely stunning especially if you can crank it up to ultra with a decent graphics card mine is rtxi feel im only at the tip of the ice berg with the game and cant wait to jump back in to explore more
so if you see this game on sale take the plunge and toss a coin to your witcher"

"the witcheris a masterpiece plan and simpleim generally not a rpg player but i played every last bit of content this one has to offer because it was so enjoyablethe characters cinematic and storytelling are as good as they geteven the npcs on side quests are developed into real characters you just might see again laternot to mention the trolls who made me belly laugh every time they open their mouths
the graphics are beautiful the music feels just right there world is detailed beyond expectationnot to mention that the content goes on forever every dlc feels like a full aaa game onto itselfi did not want the game to end and it really never felt like it would
the combat is not overly complex but gives real variety and options to every fightall to often aaa rpg combat is just a button mash to see who has the bigger statshere finesse and preparation are rewarded with care you can overcome enemies much higher level than youit all feels rewardingthe character and gear systems give similar options in how to set up your character with out being to overwhelming when you with endless and meaningless stats
i played a million hours of this game i could go on forever about itill just leave you with this my ranting convinced several of my friends to purchase this game and every one of them became as rabid a fan as i ami give the witchermy highest recommendation as one of the best games ive played in a long long time"

"if your pc can run this its one of the best rpg experiences of all time the stories behind even the simple monsters are memorable and stick with you past your playtime the worldbuilding is off the charts fantastic and the characters inhabiting the world are fully realized
other great things
 the graphics are both beautiful and cinematic through smart stylized looks and incredibly detailed textures
 amount of content theres almost too much in fact leaves you wanting for nothing in exploration
things you might not like
 leveling can be too slow or too fast depending on how much side content youre doing
 the hook investigate fight gameplay loop can become a little repetitive and predictable
 controls can be a little clunky as it tries to bridge the gap between pc and console
 death march is the most immersive difficulty and that can feel overwhelming for some"
"a little bit overwhelmed with all the quest main side contract at first the monster varies forced myself to read the books because i thought the game is just mindless hackslash getting killed everytime so i need information how to kill the monsters but after playing it for a while the quests is quite interesting it tells a new story with different perspective and the reason why these monsters exists in the first place
anyway tried to became white knight by choosing good choices while progressing the quest but more i did it i realized that most character is awful and then killed most of them lmao"

graced a ride along
with geralt of rivia
along came this song

from when the white wolf fought
a silvertongued devil
his army of elves
at his hooves did they revel

they came after me
with masterful deceit
broke down my lute
and they kicked in my teeth

while the devil horns
minced our tender meat
and so cried the witcher
he can be bleat

toss a coin to your witcher
o valley of plenty
o valley of plenty
o

toss a coin to your witcher
o valley of plenty

at the edge of the world
fight the mighty horde
that bashes and breaks you
and brings you to mourn

he thrust every elf
far back on the shelf
high up on the mountain
from whence it came

he wiped out your pest
got kicked in his chest
he a friend of humanity
so give him the rest

that my epic tale
our champion prevailed
defeated the villain
now pour him some ale

toss a coin to your witcher
o valley of plenty
o valley of plenty

toss a coin to your witcher

toss a coin to your witcher

ive played slowly exploring taking every secondary quest and witcher contract i can and have just finished the main storyline in a little overhours watching my friends speedrun the game i feel theyre missing out i probably have anotherhours left to play in the main game plus ahours more in the two dlcs combinedtheyre basically individual stories in their own right i intend to go for completeness this game is worth my time and attention

for a open world i dont feel like traveling takes too long fast travel system is good at prevent player from fast travel all the time and actually let player travel the world
story is good though its might take some times at cutscene just read fast and skip it i guess for me the romance aspect is what keep me playing
so many stuff to do you gonna get a lots of playtime from this if get bored switch to story
dont need to ask about graphic and sound its good enough
any game that can install mod is just great"

"after playing for overhours i can say with full certainty that this game is not for me this is by far the most overhyped game ive ever played the firsthours of the game were really fun but the game slowly but surely started losing steam the game started to become a chore"

"this game is so good that will make you toss a coin to your witcher"
"the witcheris in my opinion the best single player rpg ever created"
"ive played maybehours on console and im going to continue playing but so far this game has been pretty irritating
first ill note that im pretty picky when it comes to controls movement menus etc there are plenty of great games out there and i dont like spending time on a game if simply moving my character is annoying if things like finicky controls dont bother you youll probably love this game
much of the game is walking around this alone wouldnt be terrible if it werent for the frustrating movement moving a short distance or turning around in order to pick things up from the ground can be infuriating simply turning the camera to look at an item isnt enough to highlight it you have to face your character in the proper direction but somehow pressing the direction you want to face isnt enough i often have to press the analog stick four or five times to get it to register my input other times my character walks in the wrong direction altogether when i finally manage to get my character facing in the right direction he walks right past the item and i have to repeat the entire process again
the tutorial system is perhaps the worst ive seen every single menu insists on telling me about a dozen different concepts and keybindings even though aboutinare actually useful theyre probably best disabled
ultimately id rather just read the books"

"hours into the game and i still havent finished it i am completely immersed in the story of the main quest and side quests currently as of this review im still doing side quests and taking the main quest slowly i am enjoying every single bit of this game but it wasnt always like this coming from a skyrim player who played the game multiple times with the same build over and over again i was hesitant to try this game and have always wondered why it was game of the year recently i decided to try it but wasnt amazed by it since i always kept comparing it to skyrim it was stupid of me to compare it whilst still being in white orchard after watching the netflix series i decided to keep playing and i fell in love with the game
of course since i played skyrim with a lot of mods i decided to mod the game too before i played it
 good storyline
 side quests have a lot of story too

read a lots of reviews and most players got likehours playtime which surprises me a lot i was scared that i wouldnt understand the story of it because ive never played the previous witcher games the first one doesnt seem fun at all witcherlooks normal but not really motivated to play it so i just decided to read the synopsis so i could understand more of it afterhours finally beat the game and even completed the dlc bloodwine but still a lots of side quests left like damn theres so much you can do in this amazing game there were parts i had to cry and there were parts i really had to laugh i really could feel the story
graphics are insane forit still looks amazing and gorgeous i even installed some mods to make the game look even better story is breathtaking characters are amazing and really beautiful the bond they have is beautiful combat is really fun and challenging and the world is so big that you have to spend so many hours to explore everything im so glad i have played this masterpiece unfortunately there wont be a witchersince it is the end of the saga but that doesnt mean that i will quit with this game once im done with doing the side quests i will start a new game plus to experience the story again i wont ever forget this game it is surely one of my favorite games of all time
