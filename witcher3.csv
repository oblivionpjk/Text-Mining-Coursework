,2020-03-19,FALSE,,,,68.3,4,5,292030,19,TRUE,"This game is absolutely huge and rich with story.  This open world game has a lot to offer in the form of a variety of quests.  There are four types of quests: Main Quests, Secondary Quests, Witcher Contracts, and Treasure Hunts.  The world is riddled with these quests and many are something that you simply stumble upon in your travels from one place to to next.
I would highly recommend taking the time to break from the Main Story to take on these additional side quests.  If you get too far into the game some quests become unavailable or you will get very little experience for them (if you are too over leveled for a quest you only get 1 EXP).  There are so many quests to do that it can be a little overwhelming, but there is a ton of online resources you can use to help you ensure that you do the lower level quests when they were intended to be done.
The game runs very smoothly level wise if you follow closely to the suggested levels the game provides.  The quests vary as far as the level of story/lore that is offered.  Having completed the main game and both expansions on the PS4 I can safely say that this game has a great story.  I've put 300+ hours into the game at this point and can easily say that this is one of the best games I have ever played.
There is a huge range of difficulty options for this game. It can be insane Dark Souls level hard or story driven easy mode.  So if you want a game with a challenge this can be what you're looking for, but if you would prefer to explore the story this can also be what you are looking for.  Highly recommended for those who like open world RPG story driven games.  This game does have an element of RPG to it - you can play Geralt different ways and immerse yourself into the story very easily.",7.65612E+16,Indigo Summer,,,

I bought it on GOG when it came out, played through most of the story got busy. Got busy and then a couple years later got the itch to play again and couldn't figure out my GOG account so I bought it here with all the DLC
Weapon Combat-not as deep as some other games but enough to keep you grinding as you progress the story, this is how I played the game
Spell Combat-has different uses depending on the situation and can sometimes be extremely useful, also pretty deep especially after the Mutagen update/DLC quest line
Story-immersive, choices matter and will have an impact on a large amount of things, which characters do you like, romance etc.
Enemies-Get somewhat repetitive until you get to the DLC which brings a lot of new stuff
DLC-AMAZING some of the best dlc put into a game, Hearts of Stone adds a new questline which is great Wine and Blood adds a whole new area that could've been its own game in its entirety
In conclusion, should you buy this game? YES! It goes on sale pretty often and you can get the game and its DLC for a fraction of its original price, its no wonder that this game still has people buying it 5 years later. One of my favorite games.",,*The_Lawnmowing_Doge_V5*,,,

There's just two things I want to note: first, if you're on your first play through, enjoy it and take your time. Nothing will ever compare. I wish I could forget I ever played it just to experience it again. Second, pay attention to the characters faces.

stories great, characters are cool, but it does have a few issues.
The game engine is a little cranky, it works OK mostly but NPCs do glitch,  controls & menus can be buggy forcing you to save and exit to regain functions.
It's also not the kinda game you can dive into for a half hour here or there,  just beware of that.

Now it's my favorite game of all time. I've spent close to a hundred hours on just one playthrough before DLC, and if that's not a testament to the depth and pure amount of content in this game I don't know what is. The enemy variety is enough to get you hooked at first, then the well conceived quests keep the entertainment value going and the game feeling fresh. Choose a harder difficulty than you expect, as a careful and calculated approach to combat is an experience that sets it apart from other open world RPG's but only if you choose to make it a challenge. Get the gourmet perk first.
The biggest con in the game is the romance dialogue, Geralt is a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing badass until he's confronted by the notion of anything romantic or sexual, to which he turns into a 13 year old boy or what a 13 year old boy imagines a badass dude who has sex sounds like. Don't worry, Geralt's dialogue outside of this context is either quality or passable. The overarching story is high quality, and is interwoven into the game itself. The writing and the game's structure worked together to convince me the player that I wanted to find Ciri, and that's something I pay attention to and not many games can accomplish. I didn't give a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• about greybeards or Alduin in Skyrim, I just wanted cash loot. My only motivation in an RPG can't be the end of the world I don't give a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• about that because it's a video game and I'm the good guy the world's not going to end. In this game not only do you get cash loot but a *reason* to find cash loot. I would say that the Wild Hunt aren't exactly the most menacing bad guys from a plot or gameplay perspective, and as they're the main antagonists and drivers of the plot I have to ding it half a point. But what video game actually does manage a tight, compelling plot from beginning to end while achieving all of that other stuff I mentioned.

Played about 12 hours then left the game for a good 6 months. When I decided to get back into it I ended up snorting up the game and absolutely loved all of it.

2. i understand that this is a game where you need to finish side quests to be able to continue the main one as you need to be a certain level to continue, but my god if this game doesn't make it a boring chore... not only are the side quests extremely boring, they also barely gives u any XP and killing enemies also barely gives you XP (which i guess makes sense, as geralt is a witcher that dealt with monsters all the time), or maybe i just don't really understand how to level up in this game.. but it's still frustrating as i'm not a fan of the grind, at all.
3. voice acting is not as good as people say it is. maybe comparing it to other games that are similar, it definitley does... but it's still not good, geralt usually have very awkward lines every now and then and even though i didn't think the voice suited the character, it did grow on me ... the other characters are either too awkward or too dramatic.. (Ciri is an exception, she was really good).
4. do you have to show every girl naked and flirting in order to attract males? i don't really mind the nudity but the cringy fantasizing about the girls body and features is just cringy and unnecessary. i'm a girl and i feel like i'm playing a game that portrays a man's fantasy (and there's nothing wrong with that), i just can't relate and that's an issue when you're trying to grab someones attention... it's really unnecessary.
this game is really overrated! i tried my best to get into it, but i just can't.. it's too boring!",,EchoDahrk,,,

Excellent graphics

Fun fighting
Cons:

Boring story ... and lots of it.
I like games that one button will do one thing all the time. In this game, one button will do a variety of things depending on where it's being used. Add this to the fact that you're in third-person, and the game gets awfully confusing very quickly. When I play a game, I want to spend more time enjoying it than I spend learning how to play it.

,2020-03-17,FALSE,,,,134.5,23,6,292030,95,TRUE,"Gameplay: 8/10
PROS:
- The monster hunting is fantastic, and some of the monster contracts are incredibly memorable, especially on higher difficulties when you start to interface with all of the game's systems together.
- The open world also works really well. It's not as populated as an Ubisoft open world, but there's still so much to do, and the atmosphere of each location is incredibly memorable.
- You want to explore, and you are pretty well rewarded for exploring with some great gear.
CONS:
- Some of the movement controls can get frustrating during exploration. It's not the most responsive, but you get used to it.
- The soft lock-on system can also sometimes be a little weird when fighting multiple and/or flying enemies.
- The RPG elements can very quickly turn certain builds and abilities in monstrous OP builds that let you mow through everything the game throws at you. It also turns certain abilities and builds obsolete, especially at the highest of difficulties. Unfortunately, some of those are very interesting abilities and systems.
Gameplay w/ Mods: (10/10) But that's the beauty of PC. Mods! I would strongly recommend installing the FCR3 mod for small tweaks that stay close to the vanilla game. Ghost or Enhanced Edition will provide some pretty serious overhauls. There are some other smaller ones, such as the preparation mod that throwback to the previous Witcher games, or the Friendly HUD/Meditation mods that really make gameplay a lot more fluid. If you have never played the game, try it on vanilla. But if it's not vibing with you, then try mods before shelving it!
Story 9/10:
PROS:
- Characters are absolutely amazing. They drive the story forward and keep you invested in seeing every story through.
- Side quests. Everybody talks about the side quests, and for good reason. They're amazing and flesh out the world of the witcher in ways that you would be remiss to overlook in your playthrough(s).
CONS:
- Unfortunately, not every story thread and character arc (many ""side"" characters - and I say that because it's hard to say some of the characters who aren't main characters are side characters, because they're fleshed out so well) get the closure you may want. I suppose that emulates the real world, but it's unsatisfying regardless.
- The crux of the main story (Find Ciri), is so incredibly convoluted that in my opinion, it detracts from the story. It is supposed to engender a sense of urgency in you, but as an open world game, you simply can ignore it with no consequence.
- But it gives you time for the excellent sidequests, so...
Conclusion: 9/10
- I'm still playing through the Witcher 3, and just now going through and getting the achievements and stats on Steam after playing through once using the DRM-free launcher. Since I didn't use the Steam client, none of my stats were tracked, but it's a good excuse to keep playing. I think I probably have another good 80 hours on top of my current Steam playthrough. Can't recommend this game enough. Witcher 3 is one of those games that keeps pushing my backlog further and further back.",,Lima,,,

I loved the first playthrough on the hardest difficulty (light armor sword build), although I doubt I will be making a second unless I want to try a mage build on the easy setting just for fun (unlikely). It was a little heavy on what I would call grinding to be able get a ""complete clear"", specifically all of the treasures in Skellige.
I would highly recommend looking up a missables walkthrough to ensure you get the ending that you want and don't miss any quests because you did the main quest line for a given area too soon or too late. Missing the quests alone might cost you a few levels, which will make a difference later in the game.
A few pieces of advise for those just starting out:
1) DO NOT WORRY ABOUT SAVING MONEY OR STONES, especially before level 17. Just keep buying the best gear you can get from the vendors and loading it up with your best stones, and don't be afraid to pre-buy a gear set for a slightly higher level before moving to the next area. If you dismantle the gear, you get all the stones back and can put them towards the replacements.
2) At level 17, you will want to take advantage of the witcher gear sets - choose an armor type (light/medium/heavy) and stick to it for a while. Take advantage of the skill for that armor type early.
3) Don't think too hard about skill choices early on; just choose what sounds like fun or what might immediately help you. You have at least two chances to perform a complete skill tree reset.
4) It is worth your time to do a complete clear of the first area before moving on, especially the ""Places of Power"".
5) Get level 3 AXII before leaving the first area. The dialogue options that appear later are worth extra experience and should be taken advantage of.
6) Don't ignore Gwent. There are some places later in the game where you need a good Gwent deck to get the ""good"" outcome. I personally found it fun, and stuck to the ""Northern Realms"" and ""Nilfgardean"" decks because of their abilities to draw extra cards.",7.65612E+16,drkwood,,,

,2020-03-15,FALSE,,,,80.8,39,3,292030,143,TRUE,"So....finally it is time to write my review. Dear God its been so long(about 82 hours while only following the main story (and maybe 5-6 side quests).... i will make a TLDR before my review for the ones that seek the sum and not the long story.
TL:DR
+PROS+
-Toss a coin to your Witcher
-Money well spent
-Nice combat system
-Huge Story
-Quick thinking on many choices-that matters
-Main story requires more that 80+ hours
-CONS-
-Long cinematics
-Feels chaotic at first
-Randomly crashes (Driver problems,NOT game bugs)
-Takes to long to complete even just for the main story
-Sometimes quests felt like a chore
I bought the game (and both dlc) after i watched the Netflix adaptation of the Witcher. So i came here with only a small fair knowledge about this world. For starters , the combat isn't anything to extreme but not to simple either. The Graphics are quite nice and i am pleased with them. The story is HUGE...i mean litteraly HUUUUGE...and i thought Skyrim had to many hours of gameplay....Don't get me wrong i loved the storyline of the game and i got a small hint from a friend on how to play it the right way from the start (i won't spoil anything). Extremely nice storyline, soooo many choices-that-matter and so many answer under-10-seconds-choices...oh my... i don't believe i had any game like that so far in my gaming career. Best 15 euros ever spent , i mean 15 euros(On Sale) for 82+ hours of good gameplay? with the side quest it might even take me 120+ to complete it.Money well spent for sure! Enought with the +pros and lets get the -cons now.
Although i did love the game and i am definetelly recommending it to any gamer (thats has time to spare). I got extremely frustrated about the cinematics. I mean i get it it's a choices matter RPG game but...from 82 hours....only 40? maybe 30 hours felt like gameplay and all the rest felt like watching a movie with a theme of  ""pick the right question or this man dies"". Don't get me wrong i did enjoyed it a lot but if i wanted to watch a movie i would just do that and not play a game. So if you are a gamer that likes long cinematics you will love it and you will pray for a witcher 4. If you are a gamer like me that likes a beautiful made stories but prefer completing a game in less that 20 hours so that you can pick a new game to play... then you have to think about playing this game twice. The game has also quite the learning curve, feels so chaotic at first ... but after you settle with your gameplay you will find it extremely simple and not confusing at all. Encountered very few bugs but nothing gamebreakring, i had a couple of issues with game crashing but it was a problem with the windows updates and a Nvidia drivers problems, i found a solution after a while by reverting my drivers to a previous version. Lastly one of the pros is also a con for my case, it takes to long to complete the main story.....to long....sometimes if feels like they programmed it on purpose to make the game bigger but for my case just got frustrating . I even found my self strungling long hours to complete it so i can finally free disk space for a new game. You follow the main quests only and suddenly you feel like making to many side quests (although thats not the case).",7.65612E+16,DG UnD3RtAk8R,,,

The gameplay is good. Good enough atleast. Some think it's a bit too simple and I can see why. Play it on the harder difficulties.

Mostly yes but giving a game the title ""best"" shouldn't be that easy. If you're going to call this ""the best game"" then I assume, as a customer, you know what to expect from a game and the genre it was created for. The Witcher 3 is an ARPG and it nearly meets most of the things you'd expect from a perfect ARPG game. If not the best game, it's definitly the best ARPG ever created and I strongly believe that there is no such thing as ""the best game"" since there are many genres out there.
What does Witcher 3 offer different from the first two games? Many things actually. First of all it's not a linear ARPG anymore, it's open world. You have three different huge, one decent and one small interior map to explore. Combat is extremely improved over first two games along with skill tree, inventory... basically they did a great job with interface design. Story is also improved along with well-written dialogue and script. There are also many details that effect the other quests, world and characters. It might be the most detailed game I've ever played actually which is why it is regarded as the best game.
There are many more good things I can write about this game but I really wouldn't want to spoil anything for you. You might want to ask the negative sides of the game and I'll go over them as well. Roach, our beloved horse has a terrible AI. No matter where you call her, she will always get stuck or take a long time to get to you. You will usually find yourself going for her. There are also small bugs that will prevent you from completing certain activities but they are nothing like game-breaking bugs. In fact, you won't even notice them. Last thing I'm going to mention about the game is that dialogue can get tiring at some points. It feels like an interactive movie rather than an ARPG most of the time. It would've been much, much better if they had a balance between dialogue and gameplay.
That's all I have to say about The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. If you're looking for a wonderful story along with a perfectly balanced gameplay, go for it. I think everyone should experience this game or at least the Witcher universe in their lifetime.",,Yaerveth,,,

Unfortunately, while the story and context surrounding the side quests are very unique, the gameplay itself remains very simple and rigid. I realize that changing gameplay from one quest to another is not only difficult, but entirely unfeasible, so that gripe is not a slight toward this game. Rather, it's a complaint about all massive open world games, which often suffer from gameplay fatigue as a result of their enormity.
The Witcher 3 was the game that was praised by many as the greatest game of all time, but I was a little worried about starting in the third installment of the franchise. My reservations were broken once I started playing, as the game in no way expects you to have played the previous games or to have read the books. That said, there are many references to the older games that could enrich the stories being told had you already been invested in the story.",,Rexomnes,,,

This game is a masterpiece, I have been playing this games since the first game so this final game was a great closure for me. One of the greatest fantasy stories ever told, even TV shows will shiver at the level of story telling the game can offer, it's enhanced due to the interactivity that comes with the video game medium.
This game is a must have for any fantasy story lover, this game is more of a story driven RPG than a combat based RPG. The game is shallow in RPG mechanics compared to older games as CDPR dumped it down for mass appeal, I played the game using the mod Enhanced Edition, which is a must have mod if one wants a proper RPG progression along with the stellar story.
This game is a must buy, as its not about the challenge its about making choices and playing inside the universe of Witcher series and that is the joy this game brings to the people.
A word of warning: Play Witcher 1 (if not possible), playing Witcher 2 is a must have as it takes place after Witcher 2, else a new player will feel alienated and will be missing a lot of pivotal moments and amazing characters.

1st.the open world is one of the richest I have ever seen it still amazes me how much detail is put it because of a smart decision of splitting it into 6 parts,which allowed them to focus on detail in each area for example.You can instantly tell apart which is novigrad or skellige they do not blend together like cities in assassins origins for example.
2.content.well it's this games biggest strength in my opinion and I will tell you why.Unlike a game like odyssey which just tries to extend the game time and tries to make it seem bigger than it really is witcher makes the best of its content side quest for example are the best I ever seen.They are more than fetch quest they expand on characters for example Barron quests or following the thread where Lambert wants to avenge his friend Aiden I could write more but I would be here forever
3.The story quite honestly story Is simple but I mean that in the best way possible because it has a lot of detail and sub plots but they complement each other perfectly I will not go into detail about it because I'm sure some people haven't played it yet and it's quite special to experience it blind.
Well as much that I love the game the combat in this game is not one of my favourite aspects of the game dont get me wrong,it works fine as it is just feels a bit sluggish at times especially after playing games like bloodborne or devil may cry or bayonetta but that's my personal preference.
Well as you can see witcher has a lot to offer and I didn't go into all the details of this game sadly because it just is to much for a written rewiew like I dint even talk about gvent one of the best mini games  that spawned a real game that's just amazing.
Witcher is one of the greats I hope if you haven't played it yet you will give it a shot.

,2020-03-12,FALSE,1,,,26.8,63,9,292030,37,FALSE,"Look, I know this game has won loads of awards and it's considered one of the best RPGs of all time. I was skeptical, because I hated the first two games. But this was $11 so I broke down and bought it. I'm trying to get into it. I really am. But it's just not fun to play. I'd recommend this game because I can see why people would enjoy it, and it's obvious that love and careful effort went into making it. I don't want to discourage you from playing a game you might love, but it's just not grabbing me. Let me explain why:
- The controls are so clunky that they're annoying. I have to move away from loot to pick it up, stand in extremely difficult spots to loot a chest, loot flies away from monsters and isn't on the corpse and I have to keep repositioning to find it, I have to get either super close or super far away from loot to be able to pick it up... loot is a mess, and Geralt always steps too far. He can't make normal steps forward, so it's hard to position him.
- Combat isn't fun. It's annoying. Some might say it's too easy because it's just button mashing, other people might say you can make it as challenging as you want by preparing oils and using different techniques. Either way, it's not fun. It's just a hack-and-slash with bad camera angles that make it hard to tell where you're going, especially when dodging.
- The story has good source material, but it lacks substance in the game. It's like a pie that's all filling and no crust. There is so much content through side stories that the main story feels flat. The characters feel so developed that they don't need to develop more. There isn't a hook to make me interesting. The world is well designed, the characters are believable, the stories feel like a lot of thought went into them. But there's no hook in the story to motivate me to keep playing, which is bad when I do not enjoy the gameplay otherwise.
- To make matters way worse, this game is buggy! Fans seem to accept the bugs and say the good outweighs the bugs. Sorry, no. It's just annoying when I draw a sword, but there's no sword in my hands, and no damage is done to monsters. Restarting the game fixes the bug, but then I die. I reload my save and then I draw an air sword again, watching him swing nothing as if he has an actual sword in his hand. Reload the game again and finally make it through the dungeon.... frazzled and annoyed, not feeling proud or accomplished.
The point of a game is to have fun. This game just isn't fun for me. Maybe I'm not the target audience, and I love RPGs. I greatly prefer games like Baldur's Gate, Divinity Original Sin, Final Fantasy, Elder Scrolls games, Dragon Age, Knights of the Old Republic... you get the idea. I think that if The Witcher 3 was an isometric turn based game I would love it. It would solve the combat problems, increase the strategy, and help the story shine.",,Sidea,,,

And let me tell you... I really wish I had never even bought it on PS4. It looks so amazing on PC, it's incredible.
Story is pretty good, but the combat, looting, and magic system are the best. Gameplay all around is really addicting, but to be fair.. it is really hard to get into at first. Especially if you are a fromsoft veteran like myself. Once you level up and get better armor, swords, HP, all that good stuff, it is really hard not to love this game.
Could do without having to choose what to say all the time, but you learn to not mind it. That is just my opinion. It wouldnt be The Witcher without selected response however, so I'll leave that one be.

The story to the third game is much more straightforward than the last outing as it focuses on telling itself through the eyes of individual characters (like Geralt and Ciri) rather than from a bird's eye political perspective. Basically every decision you make feels like it affects you more than it does the entire kingdom. Do not take this to mean, however, that these decisions feel less important or impactful, they actually feel more essential than in previous installments because they feel more personal. I care much more about my friends and family, for example, than I do about a kingdom I've never visited. This also leads to some difficult moral decisions/choices which can have varying consequences. Sure, some decisions you make are in hindsight black and white, but most have some pretty significant trade offs that really make you question what the right decision truly was. The only real major problem I had with the main storyline was the constant introduction of characters I didn't know but Geralt did, despite having played through the entire second game and watching play throughs and story recaps of the first game. Basically if you don't read the books (or in some cases watch the Netflix series), then you will be completely lost as to who a character your talking to is, why they are important, and why you should care about them going forward. The side quests are where the game shines in story telling, as they each have their own twists and turns and mini moral quandries that shape the world in unique ways.
The game's map(s) is HUGE! the initial area you are dropped in is a bit underwhelming, but once you complete the prologue the world opens up in a big way and is incredibly easy to get lost in. The combat is pretty straightforward and while not incredible, it is serviceable and there is enough variety in enemy types to keep every type of encounter feeling fresh. My biggest problem with the combat is there really only feels like one way to play and there isn't much room for experimentation.
The graphics for the game are impressive for the time and the voice acting finally feels fully realized and solid, although some voice actors repeat over too much for my taste. The sound design for the game is also vastly improved as is the music.
Some other points of note/pieces of advice:
-Play Gwent! It's a pretty addicting and fun experience and can really help you out in a few points in the story
-Complete White Orchard's story ASAP because the world will feel a bit underwhelming otherwise
-Get the complete edition. The Heart's of Stone main quest line is my favorite of the entire game, while Blood and Wine adds a ton of content and a new area.
-Double check what save you import! Decisions in the previous entry don't affect the game hardly at all here, but the fate of a few characters is wrapped up if you decide to import. Just be sure you download the last AUTOSAVE, not manual.
-Get Witcher Armor/Weapons, they are easily the best in the game until you get to the end of the DLC's ~100 hours in
-Complete as many side quests as possible before ""The Isle of Mists"" main mission because some will get locked out after it is completed.
-Be careful how you handle Ciri at the end of the game, it plays a big role in the ending.
Seriously, get this game, it is one of the best I've ever played.",7.65612E+16,Raichu95,,,

If you didn't know already, you play as Geralt, a witcher, who travels around accepting contracts to slay monsters and the non-human (hey, Witchers gotta eat) the main story tasks you with finding a women called Ciri, who is like a daughter to Geralt, from a bunch of elves dressed in some badass armour called The Wild Hunt. Ciri is special, she has elder blood, which has given her abilities like travelling to other worlds and doing  some cool teleporting whilst fighting (you play as her occasionally, which was awesome and i hope she is the main protagonist in a future witcher game). There is also a ton of side missions and some of those storys rival the main game IMO. when playing as Geralt, you got 2 swords (steel for humans, silver for monsters) which can be upgraded along with chest, legs, hands and feet. you also have a trusty steed called Roach, who you can upgrade via saddlebags, a trophy etc so you can carry more loot and a buff. Geralt can also use some magic, called signs, which again, can be upgraded to be more powerful and have alternative functions (igni, the fire spell, can be used as a quick blast or a continuous stream of fire). there is a variety of things to do apart from the main/side quests like horse racing and the very, very good mini game called Gwent (it's a card game).  After you have been through the mammoth main game, there is 2 DLC which are every bit as good as the main game but i must say, in my opinion, that Blood and wine is the better of the two because of the location, the bright colours and the fairytale characters that make an appearance.

HOWEVER:
1. It's best to have played the other two Witchers first (I did not) - was drawn to this one, for the open world style.
2. The main character is whipped, as that they used to say... He's heroic and strong, yes, but he's pathetic when it comes to women... He follows Yennefer around like a puppy, as she treats him like dung (strings him along, uses her sxuality to manipulate and control him), with doubtful faithfulness on her own part, and leaves him generally unloved and without her companionship.... Then he chases another hyper-alpha woman around, while boot-lcking witches/sorceresses in general.
3. Can't alter his appearance, beyond very limited hair and beard alterations, and armor choices are often quite ugly (if perhaps more historically accurate in the Medieval or renaissance sense).  Thinning white hair, sharp scarred facial features, and cat-eyes, not my thing... But sure it appeals to others.

Truly amazing game:
-Graphics are good.
-Gwent
-Always more story to follow, which is very easy to immerse yourself in.
-Gwent
-A large variety of weapons and armor.
-Gwent for sure.
It adds a big open world, as well as a branching story with multiple ending based on choices made in the game.
Every quest feels important, not just the main quests.
And last but not least, something many RPGs can't seem to get right, fighting monsters remains suspenseful for the whole of the game. Especially on higher difficulty even the monsters lurking aside the streets and dirt roads will hurt you and fighting the more dangerous monsters is actually more of a boss fight than the ""go kill ten creeps"" quests we get in other games.",,unmaded212,,,

I don't know how to explain it but this game gives you a different vibe when you play it and it feels good, it's probably because of the scenery and the atmosphere of this game.

I brought the game with all DLCs in some sale last year ago and when I was sick at home I started it and what should I say: I couldn¬¥t stop.
Everything was so overwhelming: The graphics (even after the many years after release), the character design, the synchro (I stayed with the english one because the german one is not bad at all, but it reminds me a little bit of bad porn actors), the huuuuuge amount of quests and things to do. No side quest or contract feels boring, like in other open world games - some have the feeling of additional main quests.
Due to the different choices you have, makes the game replayable.
So I just not only played this game through for the last weeks, nope, I also directly started a NG+ run.

,2020-03-06,FALSE,,,,87.2,107,3,292030,1367,TRUE,"After 85 hours and many attempts over the years, I've finally finished The Witcher 3 for the first time. I feel like it's difficult to say what I want to say about this game given its acclaim and influence but I'll try my best anyway.
The Witcher 3 has an incredible level of detail, variety and content which are easily its strongest points. The sheer amount of side quests and contracts with interesting stories, surprises and challenges of their own is incredible. There are very few games which rival the side content in this game. Yakuza 0 comes to mind. The Red Dead Redemption games are up there too in terms of consistency and quality.
The environments are stunning, the music is fantastic and I am genuinely very impressed with how many different monsters/beasts there are in the game. I love that after a while, you can tell what monster you'll be facing before you even face them based on contextual clues and hints. That makes the game immersive in the sense that you feel like a Witcher. You know what you're most likely facing and what you need to do to defeat it.
I will name some negatives I experienced throughout my time with Witcher 3. They need to be said, because to claim the game is perfect or without flaws would be stupidly biased. For starters, there are a lot of bugs still. Physics bugs are rampant, mostly during cutscenes. I couldn't tell you how many times a necklace or bag started flying around the screen during a cutscene. Then there's clipping issues that also occur a lot, both of these graphical issues can really dampen the intensity of a scene.
The game also has shocking anti-aliasing. Swords, pendants, certain armors and enemies are way too shiny and jaggy. I messed around with every setting imaginable and only managed to improve it for the most egregious of the bunch. Apparently with 1440p monitors, it's less noticeable and in 4k its not noticeable at all. Unfortunately, not everyone has that kind of setup and the game could've done with some improvement graphically in that regard.
There are also a fair few gameplay bugs. When facing the second last boss of the game I had to reload a save because he just stood there, stiff as a board taking my attacks. I also had a bug where my horse despawned and couldn't respawn no matter if I fast traveled, went into a building and came out, etc.
Certain skills are also completely broken. Puppet simply doesn't work if you have Delusion activated. Other skills also have no effect or half the effect the description states. On top of that, I had to restart the game because a visual filter that was applied during one scene wasn't unapplied and it was making the game flicker like crazy where it was unintended.
Moving forward past those negatives, and I will say they are mostly minor inconveniences... I found the main story to be fairly unexciting. It has its moments, and certainly picks up the pace around the 2nd/3rd act. But before that, it moves very slowly. Adding to that, the side quests feel like they're punchier, wilder and more engaging than at least half of the game's main quests.
It probably sounds like I'm not that amazed or blown away by the game, which is and isn't true. I think The Witcher 3 does some things excellently. The environments, side quests/contracts, mechanics, world building, etc. are all top notch and are worthy of every bit of praise the game has received. But the main plot I would describe as serviceable to good... not much more than that. I personally wish the tone was darker and the writers took more risks.
Of course, your mileage may vary and I'm probably more critical than most. The Witcher 3 is still absolutely a worthwhile game packed full of high quality, varied content that the majority of AAA games wish they could boast of. I'm still keen to play more of the game's contracts and go through the expansions which I haven't yet touched.
My feeling is that The Witcher 3 is a great game with plenty of noteworthy and memorable moments. But it's also guilty of playing it too safe in parts which held it back from being truly brilliant. 8.5/10 from me.",,chaser,,,

The storyline is more than rich - it's exuberant, with details of historical events, back-stories for quests, factions within races, political systems, underground organisations, familial heritage and romantic engagements.
The developers did a fine job with the immersive elements such as environmental effects, reactions from the populace and the main protagonist's interactions with the environment. The game world is just enormous, so thank goodness there are fast-travel options. If you're not too distracted by the beautiful scenery, you might get a little preoccupied with Gwent - a card-based mini-game that echoes other character trading-card games like D&D or Pok√©mon.
Combat is very open to tactics, where the player can use any combination of swordplay (which can be enhanced with runes to give additional effects), oils (which can be applied to weapons for bonus damage to specific species), signs (an innate magical ability of Witchers), bombs, the crossbow, chevaliery (horsemanship), the environment (such as gas clouds, explosive barrels, bees) and geology (buildings, bodies of water, etc.) to bring destruction to his enemies.
In summary, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys single-player, first-person RPGs but be warned: It will demand hundreds of hours of your life. Fantastic value-for-money, though!
There are a few enhancements I'd like to see:
‚Ä?Countdowns on timed quests
‚Ä?Combat hints such as dodge, parry, counter, etc.
‚Ä?Monster weakness icons (if in bestiary)
‚Ä?A more extensive soundtrack

PROS:
Combat- 9/10  The combat feels natural and smooth. For an action RPG this is so important. Input lag or wonky enemy hit boxes really takes me out of the moment.
Music- 10/10 LOL! I am talking about game
Since when has game music been worth mentioning in a review...well...its worth it here in Witcher 3. I freaken love the game music...all of the time. A lot of games have good scores during certain cut scenes or events. You enter an epic boss fight, or an especially traumatic thing happens like one of the main characters dies. In Witcher 3 the music is just awesome...all the time....period.
Quests- 8/10 I feel like most RPG's and MMO's I have played have a ratio of about 6/10 stupid quests and 4/10 relevant feeling quests. Go get me candles..they stole our candles! Can you please walk 5 yards right over there and pick stupid berries? I just cant do it myself. I feel like Witcher 3 is more along the lines of 8/10 relevant quests and 2/10 stupid quests. To me relevant means I am doing this because the NPC ACTUALLY needs help and they just cant do it for themselves. Witcher 3 does a really good job of making you feel genuinely needed, not just a stupid errand boy.
Story- 10/10 Most games do their best to give you a good main story and some background lore, but a lot goes unexplained. Witcher 3 takes story to the next level. It explains everything, but the explanation is a natural part of the world and the effect is so immersive. To me immersion is everything. A game that looks great with great combat that has flaws severe enough to break my immersion in to the game and story will lose my interest quickly. Witcher 3 makes you feel like you are in a living world that you can lose yourself in for hours and not even realize it.
CONS:
Sound effects- 7/10 I spoke earlier about immersion, some of the sound effects are out of place or just don't sound right and they take me out of the moment. My best example is when the wind is blowing in the forest. They tried to make the sound of tree limbs hitting each other during high wind, but it sounds more like a couple of broom sticks being banged together.
Overall this game is awesome. The worst thing that I don't like really isn't that big a deal. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes action RPG's or action MMO's",7.65612E+16,Charlie Tango,,,

I'm not a hardcore fan, and I will say it took a long time for Geralt to grow on me, and some of the other characters annoyed me for a long time. After a while though, I started to get a little more into the lore and the world, and once that happened I think all of my previous grievances seemed to fall away, and understanding took its place. If you like open world games, and lots of questing, and a pretty ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing deck-builder card game with a heavy side of intensely good story, then play this game. I didn't play the first 2 (tried, but man they didn't age well), but with a little help from the wiki pages and the old google magic, I have pieced together  a pretty solid understanding of the past events.

I'm not at all tired of the game yet and in fact, I'm already looking forward to my second play through. I didn't play the first two games, haven't watched the show or read the books, but I've been able to keep up with the story well enough. There is just endless amounts of dialog (most is optional) and lore books to go through to get you up to speed.
Owned the game for years and never played because I didn't own a controller. I truly believe the game is unplayable with a mouse and keyboard. Controls took a little bit to get the hang of as well because there is a lot to do, but after the first 40 hours or so it felt natural.
I play on a pretty low end computer so I experience quite a few graphic glitches here and there, models T-posing or spinning or whatever, but nothing game breaking so far.
Those are the only two negative things I have to say about the game and honestly, it has more to do with my own hardware than the game itself. I'm really tempted to buy the game for the Switch since it has save transfer.

But to explain why I give this a positive review should be quite clear. This game is ages ahead everyone else when it comes to being a good RPG, the characters are all amazingly well made and have depth something Fallout 4 lacked.
The open world is vast, almost too big and leaves a lot of options and side content to explore not related to the main story. The world is fleshed out with encounters and Witcher contracts for you to take to play the part of a Witcher and truly feel how it is to be one. The dialogue is good and straight to the point, something Mass Effect Andromeda lacked with their 3 year old dialogue.
The combat is decent and almost downright great, the only thing holding it back is that you get stuck in a habit of using ""quen"" and just going in and hitting ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• if you play a particular playstyle, the game doesn't really try to help players play in a more diverse playstyle which I think can make combat repetetitive but this is still incomparably good to Skyrim's appalling combat.

Excellent and engaging stories, interesting lore, fun roleplaying and dialogue options. Choices actually matter.
Good ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• but kinda overrated, see below.
Definitely many issues however:
-combat is a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• for like 70% of game (crossbow, enemy stun moves, combat movespeed, cant jump in combat and arachnomorphs good examples)
-storytelling in certain areas is a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• (railroaded shani romance, lack of clues for good ending in blood n wine and white frost are good examples)
-game sometimes struggles to reconcile the books and its own canon, Ciri-Avallach is a good example
- Triss's character totally made up to try and make it so she 'competes' with yennefer for game purposes
- NG+ boring as heck

I don't even know how long, but it's been well over a year... and I still feel like I'm only scratching the surface. There's always more to do. I actually would prefer a smaller, shorter game. I say that because I know that, when (or ""if"") I finally finish the game, I'll feel like there's probably a ton of stuff that I missed. I would prefer to see everything in a game. It's like ordering a massive buffet to only eat small portions of a few items. You'll never get to experience it all. Even though this is an open-sandbox type of game, it doesn't quite feel as loose and free as Skyrim. And, since the character is assigned to you, you don't quite get the feeling like he is YOUR creation like you get from Skyrim. But the combat here is better than Skyrim. And, usually you don't have as much trouble walking uphill as in Skyrim. This is much more story-driven, and less ""be whatever you want to be"" than Skyrim. The crafting in Witcher 3 seems often too little, too late, as I've usually found better items by the time I'm allowed to craft an equipment piece. There seems to be an emphasis on potions that I really don't want to bother with unless I absolutely have to. Overall, this is a better and more refined game than Skyrim, but I miss the feeling of complete freedom that Skyrim brings. If you like sword and sorcery fantasy types of games, and were wondering whether this was worth buying or not, the answer is definitely ""Yes! It's worth buying and playing!""",7.65612E+16,immyone,,,

At that point I realized how much of an investment this game really was (considering I did just about everything in white orchard, and only a little bit in Velen), it was too overwhelming to be honest, so I put the game off for a few years until I felt the need to come back and give another go.

I'm usually not one for open world games and even less open world RPGs. I often feel like (in other similar games) the side quests are repetative time fillers that don't add to the game except add some more time, and a ton of time is usually spent on just travelling instead of playing.
This can't be said about The Witcher 3. It's an immersive world where each quest is different. The stories are interesting and the gameplay is too. Instead of being a distraction, the side quests and contracts make sense as part of the story, they help build the characters and motivations and the world they inhabit. Never does it feel like a generic time filler.
I took a long time to give this game a chance because I've not been a fan of similar games in the past but my only three regrets are that I waited this long, that I started it when I was supposed to be studying, and that I'm not playing it on a more proper machine where I could enjoy the graphics more.",,nivkaha,,,

Broke down my lute
And they kicked in my teeth

Minced our tender meat

There is not much I can complain about, I would really recommend it to everyone.
A few things which in my opinion need improvements:
1. The crossbow - shooting is very limited, especially in terms of the range, it feels like it was a close-combat crossbow which you cannot use on farther distances. Actually, you will find out that there is absolutely no need for a crossbow and it is not fun to shoot it. Even skills-wise, you don‚Äôt feel too much need or willingness to develop the skills improving the effectiveness of your crossbow. I think it‚Äôs intended to be only a secondary weapon however you don‚Äôt feel you want to use it so often. On the other hand it‚Äôs useful underwater, then again - limited and bland.
2. Porn - you have kids? You might want to know that this game is full of porn content/ dialogues. As a player I personally don‚Äôt enjoy it when a game forces you to go through erotic plots so often in order to advance in the story. In addition, there are plenty of NPCs walking around in major towns in skimpy outfits and with even skimpier language, commenting your character all the time in purely sexual manner. I find it annoying and porn-alike, not in my taste for a game. Get a hooker or a porn in real life instead of getting excited while playing. Too distractive and awkward for me. I have played a lot of games and this is the first time i found the sexual content too intensive, distracting and annoying.
3. Playing cards - not enjoyable in my opinion. It is also frustrating that once you choose to play the cards with a character you are forced to complete it and you cannot exit. From time to time I selected the wrong dialogue option and needed to play through this boring card game.

It was a fantastic experience with the glossary, which has a detailed description of the characters from main quests and side quests (It has even the description about the beasts‚Ä?weaknesses and strengths in-game). The world is just breathtaking due to the help of graphics, music and the context of each zone of the game such as Velen (a zone devasted by war), Novigrad (The big city with casinos, banks and brothels), Skellige (people of the sea with strong traditions), and Toussant (wine, knights and vampires).
The narrative doesn‚Äôt lose coherence during 150+ hours of gameplay due to an excellent work among the zones, quests and the open world itself. Each time that I start a new game it feels fresh and I can try new buildings in combat, explore each corner in the vast world or just change the endings of quests affecting the fate of many characters. I haven‚Äôt explored Skellege‚Äôs undiscovered zones in the sea (because of the sirens) as an excuse to come for a fifth playthrough in the future. Even after a fourth playthrough I still finding new quests, endings and rewards.
If you fancy movies, books and videogames you will find all together in the Witcher 3 as free content (The amount of content is almost endless). There are mini books about almost each topic of this vast universe such as zones, characters and traditions. There are many cutscenes and conversations in-game that help to develop the storyline bringing a worthy experience. I don‚Äôt regret nothing about the time that I spent in the Witcher‚Äôs universe including Gwent, Thronebreaker and the eight books were gorgeous while I was playing, reading and enjoying them.  I will be waiting for a new game in the Witcher‚Äôs universe, a new book or even the new season of the Witcher show (if cyberpunk game is half as good as the Witcher 3 it will be worthy to play it, so I am waiting for it too).",7.65612E+16,Israel,,,

My advice for maximum fun?
1. Don't be afraid of playing on the medium (or even easy, but that is a bit too easy) difficulty first time/early on - a lot of the forums seem populated by try-hard bros, but if you just wanna blast around the story then it's not bad to enjoy yourself. Or if you're a bit of a fan of the Soulsborne ""glutton for punishment"" style then you can turn it up and feel the pain - but honestly it's not as rewarding in that front, at least for me, so wombling along on medium is entertainment enough
2. Mods are your friend - the mod manger from Nexus is great, and if nothing else I personally just prefer being Henry Cavill - everyone else just looks wrong now. FCR3 is also a good mod if you want to keep mostly to the spirit of the game but with a few quality of life improvements.
3. Play with a controller. This game was built with one in mind as far as I can tell and the mouse+keyboard controls are sketchy at best and a cursed finger-destroyer of twisted pinkies and weird bindings at worse. I've connected a PS4 controller and it plays like a dream
4. This game is MASSIVE, in a good way. So... I dunno... get someone to hold your calls for a few weeks and for the love of the gods don't buy it near a significant other's birthday? The ""just one more contract"" draw is real (hence why I'm writing a review at 1:30am, three hours after I meant to go to bed)",7.65612E+16,SPCrazypants,,,

If I had one disagreeable issue with the game, it it wasn't as engaging as I hoped it would be for a new player to the Witcher series. In many ways I felt confused, and wanted to know more about the lore and in the 37.7 (relatively few) hours I plaid, I am not sure I got enough, oh, and I hate forced participation in the mini game gwent. Seriously had to do some of my own investigative work outside of the game to understand better why certain things matter, or why certain relationships between characters were the way they are. After which, I felt much more comfortable playing the game, because there was a foundation to build on. I feel the game could have improved in that area.

Game was released in 2015 and still feels like ahead of its generation. I've bought this game on 3 different platforms and currently doing a third run just because of how beautiful it is and how intriguing the story is. You just want more and more out of it, the DLCs managed to satisfy the hunger left by the main game, and I might even dare say that Blood and Wine slightly outmatches the quality of the base game, which is such a rare occasion for a DLC to be made such wonderfully and given that much detail and attention to it. The way the story unfolds, the immersion that it gives you in its own world, the atmosphere, the music, the way you connect with the characters... It's something that I've never felt before in any other game. The combat might be the only let-down, but it can be so easily ignored by what I described above. After finishing this game, I can hardly find any other RPG game that has such a gripping story, it's like every other game has become mediocre for me. I can't wait to see what the next installments are going to bring, and last but not least, if you've never played or heard this game before, you're missing out.

I always considered this game to be one of my favorites of all time but after playing it again i think im convinced this is my favorite of all time. It just does so many things so well. When i first played this game i hadnt yet played the first two games, although not necessary to enjoy this game it does help you understand what is going on in the story a bit more as it is a continuation of the previous games in the series. Now that i have played the first two games i feel like im enjoying the experience that much more.
The main draw to this game is obviously the story and the characters but I always see people bashing the combat in this game  but i think its actually fun. Sure its not the best of any game out there but it more than does the job and it can be very satisfying, especially when Geralt does a finishing move on an enemy, its so sick. There is also alot you can do with using potions, oils and signs to mix it up so its not just spam one button to win. I'd recommend playing on the higher difficulties so you can truly get everything out of the combat systems.
I think what this game does the best though is Incorporating all its story elements from main quests to the littlest of side quests into a massive open world game, its so well done. Its what all open world rpgs should strive to be imo, but most rarely succeed like the witcher 3 does. There is an insane amount of things to do in this game, it can kind of get overwhelming at some points but in a good way, not many games offer this much content for the money they are asking for it, this game is easily worth 60 dollars even just for one playthrough and you can get the complete edition with both massive dlcs for like half that at its normal price which is insane.
The dlc expansions in this game are also very impressive. Hearts of Stone is a good additional story to the game but Blood and Wine could literally be a whole other game itself. Its probably the best piece of dlc that you can buy in any game ever. It adds a whole new location to the game and a whole new storyline and sidequests. Its crazy it was only 20 dollars when it came out, not many developers toady will give you that much content for that low of a price. seriously its bigger than most full games that come out today like easily days of gameplay time.
Cd Project Red has to be one of if not the most respectable game developers out there, you can really tell they care about their games, theyre not out there just to milk every last cent out of people like most companies now a days. Its too bad we cant have more people like them making games. I also cant wait for Cyberpunk 2077 im sure it will be great as well ill gladly pay full price for any game they release they deserve it.
This game is in no way perfect, no game is but if somehow you havent already played this phenomenal game or you have yet to finish it i must implore that you do, It will take awhile to get through everything this game has to offer but you wont regret it.",,Majour Wafflez,,,
,2020-02-29,FALSE,,,,57,157,6,292030,1444,TRUE,"Every few years, a work like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt comes along, with impressive technology and a well-written story to set the bar higher and stand as one of the greats in gaming history. This game has certainly made its impact on gaming.
It's an amazing game, one of my favorites. You follow Geralt of Rivia on his search for his surrogate daughter Ciri on a job for her actual father Emhyr var Emreis, Emperor of Nilfgaard. The game is a very deep dive into the Northern Kingdoms, their politics, the war with Nilfgaard, and general life there. The story is great, with a lot of choices available and fantastic dialogue.
The Witcher 3 is really *immersive* (yes, I know, it's a buzzword used by many games in their marketing, but this one truly feels immersive). Whether you're playing on one of the easier difficulties without any preparation for fights or use of the mechanics, or you're on Death March, with a heavy focus on things like crafting and fighting, the Witcher 3 really makes you feel like Geralt. This game has kept me playing for hours on end, not even stopping to eat. It's one of the only games that's actually immersed me so hard it distracts me from things I need to do to survive.
The art and graphics is very good, with each region feeling very different and natural. The Witcher 3 is a technical marvel in this aspect, with very good use of graphical technology in showing its world and its characters. The animations are sometimes repetitive, but you stop noticing it when you're sucked in.
The music and sound is also great. The music itself works well, and it works even better when it's combined with the world. The voice acting is good, and you never feel like you're in a game when you talk to the characters. Everything about it is incredibly memorable.
The game is very long, with several dozens of hours of a campaign, and even more in the DLCs (around 30 hours each), but it never feels boring. I'll probably be replaying this game a lot in the coming years - I simply just can't put it down and forget it.",,Lt. Thighs | Callsign - Thicc,,,

Get the DLCs because more skill choices are added from the start. The map, menu, equipment, horse riding, swimming are all clunky and lack some the feature a player might want. The story, monsters, and romance carries the game along. A great world of lore to get into when you need one!

The game is simply boring. There is little freedom in your choices and all sense of exploration gets nullified by placin ? markers at places of interest.

I thought I would make the game interesting by playing on the highest difficulty, but all it did was up the enemies stats, making the already bad combat system only last longer.

But something about it still interested me, and I bought it and enjoyed it when it eventually dropped, pre-enhanced edition worts and all.
I was honestly surprised when they were coming out with The Witcher 2. I assumed the first game didn't do very well, but I was glad to be wrong. Even as one of the early adopters to the series... never did I expect the masterpeice that everything was building towards...

So this is actually my second time playing through this game, originally I picked it up upon release on PS4 and had and amazing time with it then as well. However, due to whatever reasons, I never did beat the game. So when a sale came around I decide it was finally time to pick this game back up on PC and beat it. I am extremely happy I did, the story alone it really strong and worth experiencing alone. However, the multitude of side quests and quality of these side quests are the true gem. They aren't just recycled fetch quests like you'll experience in other triple A games of this size, there's actually meat and content to side quests that other studios should take note of! (Side note, I would say 80%-90% of side quests fall into this category) Let's talk about size as well, the play area is HUGE! with, for the most part, realized areas worth exploring. This is a world you'll want to explore the nooks and crannies of as the developers did a great job of placing items of interest in remote, of the beaten path, locations. All of this is just coming from the experience of the base game all well as I've yet to touch the DLC. This game could easily still warrant a $60 price tag for the time and content, and most importantly quality of content!
With everything said so far it's time to hit on the negatives. You'll encounter bugs for sure! I have a few crashes during my play time so that's something I'd look out for and possibly change the auto save timer to 5 mins to ensure you don't lose a heavy amount of progress. Gwent as well, while not a bad aspect of it, it definitely isn't the brightest star of this game to myself and makes it a little meh that you'll have a handful of quests left over should you ignore this side of the game.

Needless to say, I had a great time. The story is pretty good, the combat is fun, and the insane amount of side content kept me going for a while. The choices you have to make in the story actually seem to have consequences and affect the story (because, well, they do). Finding a game where your choices actually have real weight to them is hard to find, and I did not expect to find that this game does that pretty well.
The Netflix series was amazing, and gave me the energy to actually complete a playthrough of the game without getting burned out. This was a phenomenal gaming experience, one that isn't for everyone, but if you are a fan of these style of games (Skyrim, other games like Skyrim because I'm just blanking right now), I highly recommend this.

(I've never written a review here, but there is so much hype around this game in late 2019, because of the TV-series, that one can be easily fooled.)
I've spent 67 hours in the game and I still haven't went to Skellige, which to my current understanding is one of the 3 main locations. So it's not a short game.
The scenes are beautiful and the changing circumstances (weather + day/night) are adding different vibes to the same area every time you would return.
Though the character model are rigid which show the age of the game, it's only disturbing in cutscenes with less clothes.
The music being dependent of the location plus the action you are doing can be repetitive if you focus on some tasks, but the single tracks are nice and helping the immersion.
Fast travel points are well placed and dense enough. This leads us to the first annoying thing in the game:
-the horse
Riding your horse meant to help you cover longer distances faster. Taking into account the distance between fast travel posts and how disturbingly buggy it is to call the horse, this becomes a big trouble. The main beauty of the game would be to roam the wild. Instead you spend a minute to get on your horse whistling the whole time, because sometimes it appears under a bridge, in the bridge, stuck in the woods or not at all. You start running to not waste more time and to give another chance to Roach to spawn to a better spot. Then either your reach a fast travel point and miss out half of the game or you mount your horse, become three times more powerful as on foot and slay any monster. Then of course you have to get off the horse to loot some monster blood and you can only wish that you are on a nice open field where Roach can not face an unmovable tree and dash it endlessly.
Another engine bug which can ruin you experience are:
-hints
More like the lack of them. There are basic elements in the game and some I missed out completely because I got a short message about it when I was past level 15. Alchemy was on topic and not only I didn't focus on this, but as a side effect I have also no skills purchased for it. The reason for this is that I tried to play this section of the game without it's help so I compared it to Oblivion, and this one is just far more because so I was overthinking. That game is making a lot more things right for example:
-stealing/looting
This is just a small annoyance to some, but I was used to in Oblivion that you can only freely steal from anyone if you worked hard and became a master thief. This feature is missing here, which means you walk into the house of the poorest family, your best friend or greatest foe and start looting dried fruits from all the cupboards. No one bats an eye, no chill, no fun and feels pretty awkward and morally questionable at the beginning.
But all the previous issues are small disturbances and could be forgiven, not the:
-leveling
I hope there is a well defined sequence you can play this game in a challenging, enjoyable way. But I must beg to differ. The early part was incredibly frustrating and then suddenly easy on that degree that you start questioning why would you start any mission. Why is that? Every task has a suggested level assigned to it. As well every combat item has a minimum level that you can use it. So if you are getting bored following the main quest and want to do some good old hack and slash you head to the woods. Then you realize how under powered you are and try to buff up a little bit. This is the point when it becomes clear making a two minute conversation with someone in a quest where you make 2 ""decisions"", which are changing a single line in the text from you partner gives you the same amount of XP as killing +4 level beasts for a couple of hours. Reaching level 7 from level 6 took hours, I couldn't wait to be able to use my new sword I saved money for. Then I popped into the city to speed up the process and left level 15, the sword being a garbage sold for 5 golds... The monsters I was struggling with earlier couldn't even slow me down and I have a list of side quest above my level giving 1-2 xp and offering no challenge at all. I even missed out a big chunk of the story as I was sent to north which I followed literally instead of the detour to the east which was foreseen by the writers, but the blockade which you I should have dealt with was only effective there not the other way leading to the destination city.
Now I'm in a world where I can kill dragons with my pinky in one forest and could be teared apart from level 40 wolves in another, having 3 different main storylines which contradict each other(working for someone in one, while I'm planning to kill the person in another). I already have failed mission because I finished another earlier and the player I should have interact with is not available anymore.
As a bonus:
-gwent
is the minigame which kind of confirms, that this is happening not by mistake, but by design. The first rounds you just have no chance. Then there is still tiny little period when you have to make an effort to be successful. The fun part, which is challenging and therefore rewarding. It's not impossibly hard and not blatantly easy. Then you win a few games and it's over. You have such a strong deck, you don't even have to try, you just win and start the grinding, to fast travel to locations search more unique cards, win them in two minutes and restart the cycle.",7.65612E+16,ruppi,,,

I personally watched the series first, read the books then played this games since it's a ""sequel"" to the former mediums.
I recommend taking time to play this game properly, because one can rush it in 40 hours while you can play it for at least a 150 hours and still get pleasant surprises.
This is the only game where the side quests are as good as the main story.
The DLCs are absolutely phenomenal and are better than other standalone RPG or AAA games in their entirety.
Having read the books, seeing the characters and the truly rich and detailed world come to life altogether was very pleasant. The Witcher's word is grim but authentic and beautiful at the same time and countless times I have found myself admiring the amount of efforts the devs put into this by meticulously studying Andrezj Sapkowsky's books.
I've played many RPGs but this is by far the best one I've ever played.
Great story
Great combat
Insanely beautiful world and lore

BUT, after buying Witcher III just because it was cheap and playing it I ended up MESMERIZED with the story, the choises, the beautiful and eerie landscapes, the tone of the characters, the casual jokes and the fluid game play (simple but beautiful). And of course, the game within the game: GWENT.

Perhaps I won't start the DLCs tonight; perhaps I will create a third playthrough just to experience that novel feeling of fun and discovery. It really is that fun to me.",7.65612E+16,DrSchlopp,,,

Very few RPG's these days live up to the name, they just pretend to, Witcher 3 on the other hand...
PROS
Your choices actually matter - A lot of games with 'choice based' story mechanics only give you the mere illusion of what you say on that dialogue wheel actually matters towards the end goal, like Skyrim or Fallout 4; Not Witcher 3, I was shocked when I got the bad ending my first time through.
Even though you don't necessarily make your character in this game, you make his decisions, and even though you don't form his face in a character creator menu, Geralt feels a lot more like YOURS than any Skyrim character of yours ever will.
The Story has grit - There's rarely good or bad in this game, like I mentioned before your actions have consequences...
You kill a dog to save a boy, the wolf pack for you, you kill a boy to save a dog the whole village is after you.
The gameplay is genuinely fun -
The whole role-playing bit, this game pretty much hits right on the money, no doubt; What about the gameplay part? Well the action is no place to complain either i think.
Sure i've had those ""I dodged over there, not over there!"" moments or the ""I didn't mean to take that potion!"" moments, But! It's well rounded, obviously taking influence from the Dark Souls series of games like every other action Action RPG these days but can you really argue? It works and it's fun.
The game doesn't force you to play any specific way. You don't have to use potions, concoctions, or bombs, but if you do, you'll find it completely rewarding when you've planned an epic battle beforehand and find yourself completely ripping through enemies thanks to it.
If you plan right you can turn a challenging battles into a breeze, and it's only because you've prepared yourself.
None of this will be as satisfying though if you don't play on blood and broken bones difficulty... ahem... let me repeat myself... PLAY ON BLOOD AND BROKEN BONES... or death march if you like being pegged...
CONS
Horse jank - Your horse, Roach, can be a lil ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô?at times. Sometimes he has a hard time doing a 360. Resting your horse to regain stamina is a bit gay... but by NO means whatsoever does this take away from how badass this game is deep in. By the end you'll end up naming your next Minecraft horse Roach anyways so what does it matter...
Geralt jank - You move like a robot. What can i say this whole game feels like it's on ice; It's irritating at times but i've never felt like punching a whole through my monitor. ledges are ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•es, fight near water you probably dodge and find your self in the middle of the ocean, and getting on boats is like putting on pants two legs at a time...
IN CONCLUSION
THIS GAME IS GREAT...
The cons are so minor they're practically non-problems and the pros far outweigh any issue you can throw at it.
You'll fall in love with Geralt and his friends, regardless if you had played the last two games or not, I know I didn't. So finally, I recommend that you steal you parents credit card as soon as possible, and hop into this beautiful, beautiful experience as quickly as you can...",,bube_,,,

‚òëStory is tough gripping with lots of deeply interesting characters & lore
‚òëCombat is extremely satisfying, with countless different builds you can go so you won't get bored, ever.
‚òëVery addictive always feel like coming back and trying a new build/dialogue options
‚òëMusic is near Skyrim levels of breathtaking with a heavy influence of it, so if you liked Skyrims ambient music & fast battle music you'll love this too
‚òëSide quests are nearly always fun to do with lots of interesting concepts, returning characters from previous games and crazy enemies
‚òëCan import your save from The Witcher 2: Assassin Of Kings which effects some in-game story decisions
‚òëMost of the characters in this game are very likeable/hateble in a very, very good way
‚òëTsundere goth girl that is in love with you but doms you around
‚òíEXTREMELY BUGGY. One of actually no, this is the most buggy game I've played in recent years. A list of some of the few hundred bugs I encountered were: Crashing, loading screens not ending, enemies being stuck in a T pose and easy to kill, falling through the map, not being able to use signs unless you reload, potions not going off and the worst one I came across by far is Level Scailing. TURN THIS OFF! As even RATS can one shot you if you reach a certain level which is absolutely ridiculous and certain fights like the Djinn one becomes impossible with it on if you are a higher level then the quest
‚òíNoticed in dialogue, if you choose an option rarely Geralt doesn't exactly say what you picked just either along the lines of it barely or not relating to it at all. Very rare this happens but noticed it a couple times playing it through twice
‚òíCrafting is VERY expensive late game, so expensive you have to keep finding ways to farm money if you don't have contracts left and want to keep crafting gear/weapons by killing high level enemies and selling their weapons which doesn't always work as smiths have a set amount of money which can run out if you sell them too much
Overall this is a phenomenal game I would arguably say is better then Zelda: BOTW, but bugs hold it back by a lot. In BOTW there is a lot of great ones like launching across the map riding your shield or beating the game from the get go but in this game, the bugs are ONLY an annoyance always hindering your gameplay.

The story is rich with characters, the dialogue is pretty good, character models are outstanding, and overall a must have, especially on sale. There is so much to do, even without the DLCs. I really cant say anything else new that hasn't already been praised by millions of other people. Just get the game.
There are some downsides. Since there are huge maps, there is a lot of walking, not Borderlands worth of walking, but its a lot. Luckily you can ride your trusty horse Roach around. The crafting is a little intricate, you'll be picking up loads of leaves and herbs, but not end up using most of em for the good stuff. The inventory is pretty decent though, so its makes up for that. There are a few more, but honestly, they get outweighed by the great story line and gameplay. i'm not one that  cares much for story lines, but this one is worth it.",7.65612E+16,Sterling_Archer,,,

I don't know I ever managed before the Roach improvements and being able to fast travel from anywhere, the signposts method requires too much long distance travel on a horse that pales in comparison to say the AC franchise without mods.
Now if only they took a page from Red Dead's book and allowed you to mount your horse as it runs beside you as stopping to wait while it clumsily navigates itself to you with the haste of a snail is awful.

None of the key moments seemed particularly weighty at the time, and the options you are given all seem pretty random, meaning that the various options don't conform to one or another moral/ethical worldview. You make a more or less random choice and you don't find out the consequences until the the game's final cutscene. But this is really a small criticism, or easy to forgive and forget. The game is very deep, has tons of customization of your boy Geralt in both gear and skills. The only other minor quibble is that sometimes combat, especially unarmed combat, is more exhausting for the player (you) than it seems to be for Geralt.

,2020-02-23,FALSE,,,,58.6,225,6,292030,85,TRUE,"I bought this game thinking, ""great, finally a game all about witches"". However, it turns out it is in fact not entirely about witches, despite there being several witches throughout the game. Before you finish letting out that long sigh of disappointment, let me assure you, it is very much so a game about witches.
The game centers around Geralt of Rivia, a 'witcher' who struggles with his identity after being forced to conform to his adoptive family's witcher teachings from a young age, despite self-identifying as a witch. After years of psychological torture and identity crisis, he has come to terms with who he is. Geralt now seeks to break the cycle of identity norms that had both physically and mentally altered his life forever, by finding his old apprentice Ciri and letting her know it's okay to pursue her destiny as a witch. Although there's only several witches throughout the game on your journey to find Ciri, there's plenty of great filler content along the way, including all of the creatures you'd expect in a great witch game like ghouls, imps, werewolves, and ghosts. Now I know what you're thinking, no witch game would ever be complete without magic and potions, and you're right. Thankfully, this game has you covered despite their non-traditional approach. Although Geralt still frequently uses magic, it is not his primary catalyst for destruction as with a typical witch. Nor does he require a cauldron to brew potions or a spell book to cast his spells, but we have the witcher teachings to blame for this. Sadly, the one thing that's definitely missing from this game is the ability to fly, but I'm afraid the witcher teachings have ruined this possibility as well; although to be honest, I'm personally convinced this is solely the result of laziness on the developer's part, but I digress.
Despite needing some work in the witch department, it's probably the closest thing us fans have to a witch game for now. Overall, I'd give it a 10/10 for its endless hours of content, remarkable RPG decisions/consequences, solid combat system, and its resemblance of a witch game. If you are one of those people who aren't expecting this game to be entirely about witches, I'm sure you'll have fewer issues with the game and I would 100% recommend it.",7.65612E+16,StinkyFist,,,

Visually, the game is gorgeous. If you've got a high-end PC, crank up those graphics and enjoy all the work that went into making the world. You're in for a treat.
The story and the mechanics, I think, are going to depend a lot more on you as an individual.
The story begins with you attempting to find Ciri and Yen. Yen is found fairly quickly, while finding Ciri is a much larger quest. As for myself, I've just never been able to muster much enthusiasm for Ciri as a character or how Geralt interacts with her. This takes a lot of the wind out of the sails of the main storyline very quickly. The side quests range from brilliant to incredibly boring and mundane, and it can be hard to tell which are going to be which.
Combat is very showy, but still feels a bit stilted, as it did in the first two games. Some people don't mind this or even enjoy it, but I found it causing a lot of problems in terms of my being able to get into the flow of a fight. There is a ton of stuff for your to craft, if that's something you enjoy, but I found that it generally didn't bring much satisfaction for me and often felt fairly fiddly for minor gains.
Gwent is another large feature of the game, and if you enjoy the card game, there is a lot of possibly enjoyment to be had from playing and building the deck, but it was another spot for myself where I just found myself not really enjoying the process much and wondering why I was doing this.
At the end of the day, I'd say this is a AA studio that managed to produce a AAA game. But my problem is that I find AAA games to feel largely kind of bland and lifeless and the fact the it came from a AA studio who couldn't quiet put the resources into polishing and detailing the mechanics like AAA studios do, end up doing it a disservice. If your primary play and enjoy AAA game studio products, this is absolutely worth a buy. It's a chance to see how smaller developers make up for their lack of money to blow on the strength of stories and making strong mechanical systems that create interesting game play loops.
If you're primarily an Indie Game or AA studio supporters, your mileage may vary. It can often times feel like a game design to be much smaller, instead spread out and stretched thin over too much game time. If can often times feel like a story that should have been better that was watered down a bit for mass appeal. But the core systems are still strong, perhaps just not as strong as they could have been.
I'm giving this game a thumbs down for me, but that's just out of recognition that it isn't really a game designed for people like me. Not because it's a poor game.",,Action Bastard!,,,

The DLC's are great editions adding around 30 hours onto the main game in my case. Blood and Wine is more fantasy oriented with lots of story references, Toussaint is the best looking area followed by Skellige. Heart of Stone's story has some impactful moments through it but feels like a bit more of a grind until you start to uncover real truths towards the end.
Overall, I played this game like a completionist to begin with but with the shear amount of map content and side missions this becomes very difficult and you tend to go with the flow at your own comfortable rate.
This is hands down the best individual game i have ever played, even though it took several years for me to come around and finish it.

Although coming with the highest expectations, the quality of the game caught me of guard, surprised of how it perfected the modern gaming experience. 'Why' you ask? what is so good about it?
It's not tons of gamers follow as sheep, praising it because its popular to, the truth is that the Witcher excel every category -
Incredible graphics and design, that would make it a thrill to explore, full of HUGE amount of content, events and adventures to make your life feel boring without, super solid RPG elements crafted wisely, breathtaking soundtrack, intriguing gameplay and animations, and if that's not enough, and most important in the gaming world now days -
Magnificent story telling - not because its unique, but because every character lives and breathes through dialogue and great voice acting, using a well detailed script which give every one of them the complex and sense of realism, that would make you care for so many of them.
This game is so packed with areas and quests, endless options and decision to make, and what you choose is going to take effect, so you should always keep that in mind.
If I'd try to find points to improve (I needed to search so much for it) - The RPG core of the game, that is a bit overflowed and maybe overdone containing amount of items and elements to deal with, feels so many times scattered and overwhelming not in a good way, and you won't feel like going over so many of them, and ignore a lot of items.
But if it's the only thing that wasn't perfect, who am I to complain?
To sum up - I don't have lot of patient for endless RPG's, but 192 HOURS ON RECORD just flew by! Anything left to say?
Thank you, CD Project Red, for changing the life of countless gamers!

Using the boat has got to be one of the most tedious and boring parts of the experience, that's one part of the game I tried to avoid as best I could. For a person like myself, who likes making sure all of the maps in games I play are filled out, I stopped checking each question mark after I realised that the majority of them, especially in Skellige (specifically the ones on water) are absolutely useless. There is little to no incentive to collect loot for any reasons other than selling it as your Witcher gear will always be better than anything you come across. This ruins any satisfaction I would have with exploring this otherwise very beautiful and immersive world. There just doesn't seem to be a priority in throwing a bone at the player for curiosity and adventure, which is present in many other games of this and previous generations...
There are still many things I can't remember off the top of my head, however despite all its flaws I still stuck through with the game as the highs in quests and storytelling certainly do reach a high peak in certain parts. I'll be lying if I said I didn't immensely enjoy the stories told in the Witcher 3. It's definitely the strongest part of the game - the writing and interesting characters.
If you love western RPGs or action RPGs then you've already played this game. If you don't know what a WRPG/ARPG is, then this is an easy choice to pick up to try out as a first. I find this game quite simple once you learn a few intricate parts such as potion management and properly casting signs.",,Varkster,,,

Technically solid. Gameplay is fine if you enjoy the loop. I just don't. I remember thinking Witcher 2 was ""fine"" but it also didn't particularly hold my attention.

It is an open world, with a amazing main story plot, tons of interesting side quests, ruins and things to explore, monsters to kill everywhere, things like armor sets and cards to collect, and many more!
It's almost an experience, one that can only be understood after you've played it.
It's my third playthrough, and the story and quests still are exciting and refreshing. Oh, and the decisions you make do matter!

,2020-02-21,FALSE,,,,536.4,249,1,292030,185,TRUE,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, other than Earthbound, is the game I've put most hours into. 522 at the time of this review. It's a really impressive game for what it is, a sequel to 2 rather ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• games (imo). The open world is one of the best in gaming, only beaten out by Zelda Breath Of The Wild. But this sadly is not a great achievement like it might sound like. Most open worlds in games are pretty bland and boring with billions of things to that are all the same at the end of the day. Though this world feels more alive and interesting than those other ones, it's still cursed with rather boring tasks like killing bandits in their camp, or in an abandoned village, or monsters in a cave and monsters in their nests. All which reward pretty useless stuff.
The combat also lacks, once you get a hang of it. Dodge, attack and repeat endlessly it gets easy as ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Even on death march. The hardest difficulty. Though the swift moves and dance like sword play is pretty fun at times like when meeting humanoid enemies.
Where The Witcher really shines, and I mean REALLY shines, is at the side quests. They are by far the best I've ever played through. Almost all have really unique and fun stories attached to them and most hide that they're fetch quests rather well. Highlights for me are Where the Cat and Wolf Play (Free dlc quest) and Carnal Sins.
Speaking of DLC, both expansions are very good, Hearts of Stone being the best of the two, but Blood and Wine providing most of the content will bring you most of the playtime when comparing the two. There is also free DLC like quests and other addons that are circlejerked to oblivion and beyond. Sure they are cool, Cat and Wolf is a highlight. But not more special than free content other devs add to their games. So why it's a ""plus"" when people recommend the game to others is something I don't really understand. The free DLC can be skipped and not much would be missed (other than cat and wolf of course)
Graphics are good but sound is odd and feels off at times. Everytime the Wild Hunt is on camera, it sounds like the most dramatic of sound effects were added to a guy getting of a horse. The inns also have this weird crowd noise when it's like two people in there. There are plenty of other sound issues but none that really bother me. Soundtrack is also rather meh.
I might sound negative in this review which is odd as I'm recommending it, but this game is still so ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing good even though it has some flaws. I was never really bored when playing and the immersion levels were through the roof. I really recommend you play this game atleast once, including it's DLC. You can get plenty of hours out of this beast. I would say around 70 your first time around.
Also Gwent is bad, fight me. Yes it's a minigame but it has ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• balance. If you have an okay deck you'll never lose, and I mean NEVER.

Story goes actually like this...
Find Ciri. Find Ciri. Find Ciri... ok, why do I have to find Ciri again? I already forgot...
Who knows about Ciri? No idea. Ok, let's ask a witch... she knows nothing. Ok, let's ask someone else. He knows nothing. Once you find a guy who knows something about Ciri, he won't tell you. He wants favour A and B and C and then only he tells you. So you go around and around and around and do all kind of favours for all kind of people... not, that these have to do anything with the actual main story. Nada.
Ok, so once you do all kind of favours for Guy A he tells you what you know about Ciri. And where is she now? He has no clue. Why the heck did I had to do all this, I'm actually no further. So, you start over again. The whole thing starts from beginning. Go to another place and ask all kind of people to see who knows something about Ciri. Finally, another Guy B knows something but he won't tell you either, because he too wants favours from you .... and so the whole  thing keeps repeating and keeps repeating and keeps repeating.
Wait... why did we do all this in the first place? By the time you're done with all the favours, it's no wonder, you've forgotten why that even mattered... after all, you're only doing things for others and nothing is for you.
You realize, your character is actually boring. The actual storyline could also not matter to you at all (not like in Skyrim, where YOU are DRAGONBORN), after all, you have no emotions anyway as everyone says, so effectively, you do not truely care about others.
You realize, The Witcher 3 has actually nearly no story at all... if you remove all the noise. Take just a handful of the loading cutscenes in between and the true _main_ story is told. The rest, noise which is unimportant.",,kdimi11,,,

The only RPGs that come near this for me are Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Persona 5, Fallout 1 & 2, and JRPGs like Chrono Trigger and old Final Fantasy. So, in other words, RPGs that are almost nothing like The Witcher 3.
Note that I originally played this on PS4 before I got a good PC and used a save file to start my PC game with the main questline complete, so I've actually played for around 200 hours, something I've never done with any other game.
I'm not saying it's perfect, it's not. But it tries so much more than any other game and gets basically everything right. Except for that ****** fall damage. Speaking of small annoyances that are easily fixed with mods, there also lots of solid mods! My personal favorite is Immersive Cam by KCS.

When it came out on switch I bought it and gave it another shot but on the go. I gave it more of my time and really payed attention to the games story and great details and it has been a great journey to see. I have not used many of the games great deep systems such as oils or potions to make my life easier I really enjoyed the story and some challenge but even without this the game still feels deep and if you want to use those you can but I didn't meaning its an option not needed to have fun. Granted the game has some flaws like there are so many characters that you can't care for them all some you need to help and while doing that you can't wait for the mission to be over. Loot seems to be you need to find it early or don't craft anything as exploring as a few levels higher causes your gear to be better than anything you can find, BUT it makes really good stuff to sell such as swords that are hundreds of crowns. If you complete all the side missions as they come and often explore all the question marks on the map you obtain many weapons and armor if you sell that You won't need to worry of money like me having always more than 15 thousand without really trying and just spending when I want on crafting my gear. I will say nothing about the story other than I liked it you need to believe you are Geralt and shouldn't do anything he wouldn't like being with a woman even though he loves someone else and  this can cause negative things later in game. By playing slow it really is slow I have played for hours exploring and getting like 50 EXP but less than a full main mission gives 500 EXP normally, contracts and side missions never give the same amount of EXP like a main mission but it can give at one time a few hundred crowns or an item worth selling and crowns or a good item (good item isn't too often) the side mission never really feel the same other than maybe doing looking around with your senses but thats what makes a witcher. Combat is very rewarding like when using a good spell in the mix or not getting hit or the finishers that cut limbs off of enemies is really cool to watch. Crafting is defintly a friend being if you don't craft then you won't be at full potential and the things to craft isn't hard to come by if you kill and loot all your monsters then that is fine or if its something that can be bought at a merchant with your thousands of crowns. I still have more to do like the DLCs but if anything else comes to mind that I wish to add I will edit to give a better review to anyone that is thinking of this game. If your on the fence then don't buy it now wait for a sale or the time this is a game that requires many hours and full attention you need to give it a shot as it throws many things at you right out the gate. If you will give it the time and are on the fence it is a good game I have no clue about your game standards but I enjoy open world games and it is a good one. If you wish to try it steams refund policy is great just set a timer for about and hour and a half so you can stop the game and make a decision. It should give you the main set up within the first 90 min so you can see if it is something you enjoy. I would not recommend if this is a game that will be boughten than never played like me the first time, to enjoy you need to listen and make the right choices to have a connection to the characters and story and the world.  It says I have played the game on steam for about 19 hours that not including switch in a recent update it allows me to play on my switch on the go then at home continuing the same save on PC but on my switch I have roughly 70 hours. I hope you have reached the end of this and that I have been able to help you in buying this game or seeing if it was right for you.",,Pinleech,,,

I set my expectations way too high.
The story is kinda interesting, but not for me really.
If you like rich story games but are slightly impatient, you will hate this game.
There are a lot of other basic things that I hate about the game.
The unnecessary amount of overlay destroys the athmosphere.
From a game which puts a lot of work into athmosphere and design,
you would expect that NPCs are decently reacting realistically,
But sometimes they just do not care about the fact
that some of their companies just died and completely ignore it.
You go into a bar and because you saved the son of the tavern keeper, she says that you can buy stuff for free,
but then it doesn't apply practically. You still have to buy stuff.
Yeah, it would be too easy, but also realistic.
Sometimes, Mods walk into each other in conversations with the player,
NPC reaction animations do not change over fluently, makes them look like crazy witches.
Unrealistic destroyed villages: Usually, you would not see armies leaving behind some villagers, rather than enslaving, killing or ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• them. The same goes for buildings or the only single coat of arms in the middle of the village.
More realistic would have been half dead or completely dead villagers. Anything but this.

I don't think there is any other game like this that you can just play for top 14 hours a sitting and not get bored once.
A game that is never unengaging, always keeps you intrested on something.
If it runs well its the graphics holds up to this day, and I would say where it comes to clothing its one of the best till this day, just the amount of detail is insane
A game so dark, beautiful and poatic at once...
Some people think this game is not for everyone, thats correct, not for everyone that does not have time to waste, but I think if some just try to play the game right and get the graphics done, I think 95% of them would just fall in love with this master piece.
150 minimum hours of gameplay including DLCs, 4 maps with each more then a 100 things to be doing AND its bloody cheap on steam, but theres a reason why people are wanting to pay full price.

This game is one of the most mesmerizing, electrifying, phenomenal RPGs I've ever got to play.
During my run-down on my Game of the Decade (for entertainment purposes), I couldn't help but return to Geralt in this beautiful story-rich game.
You aren't a hero desperately trying to save the world, nor a villain waiting for it to decay. You are Geralt of Rivia, a monster-hunting witcher with a personal journey of finding your surrogate daughter, Cirilla.
You will come across a desolate, realistic world filled with complex, mature story lines and themes awaiting the players who decide to ignore their real-life responsibilities in order to live through Geralt with the potential
What, personally, puts the
in front of every other open-world RPG title is that each and every distraction from the main quest feels meaningful and impactful rather than an empty map-event. In an age where countless developers seem to fill their games with repetitive side-quests and boring events with no consequences, it‚Äôs undoubtedly refreshing to see worthwhile content brimming from potentially the biggest open-world game ever.
Whether you‚Äôre new to the series or a Witcher saga veteran, you‚Äôll continue to learn new things about Geralt and his world as time goes on, allowing your game-play to feel fresh every step of the way.
Kudos to CD Project RED for this masterpiece.

First of all, I've heard of this game since 2018 when i first got my laptop. I know this game because it is always on the top sales.2 years later, I bought this game last week and spent 122 hours to finish the game on Blood and March Difficulty, discovered most of the question mark on the map, finished both DLC, upgraded all my weapons and finished with a satisfying ending.
Pros of this game:
- Thick plot and very interesting story line, got attached to the story line right after i finished the Baron quest, awful ending but understand happy ending exists only in fairy tail.
- Good combat system, thought the camera angle is not really fully developed but it is great than you can dodge and roll, cast spell, bombs, crossbows, parry, counterattack. Various of combat styles is the unique part of being a witcher, two swords but the combat style is always different.
- Balance Enemy system, there's an upscaling button in the game which you can witch off or on, enhance the game experience as the previous monsters are not easily defeated when you're on higher level. Besides, you can always challenge some of the higher level enemies using specific skills and spells, not to say it is guaranteed that you will win but proud to slay a witcher contract which is not on your level.
- Travel system, in an open world game traveling is the most unpopular option for most of the players, fast travel is preferred because it actually saves a lot of time. There are tons of marker on the map which you can discover and never have to travel again.
- Crafting System seems good as there is filters, ingredients that are needed for alchemy or crafting can be pinned and will highlighted in a white box whenever you visits the shop.
Dismantle is the key in saving a lot of time for the resources needed in some crafting.
- Graphics, simply awesome and you will most definitely felt like you're in Velen, Novigrad, Toussaint and Skillige. There are epic views such as sunset, mountains, ruins, castle and so on.
Cons of this game:
- UI for inventory, from my opinion, this inventory looks like something from the warcraft time. It is not bad but there's room to improve.
Overall game experience : 9/10

you will have a lot of fun, fights are good, story/characters amazing, detailed, interesting. You will laugh, cry a lot.
Makes you question your morale and the world around you. I wanted to finish all quests, because who knows what kind of story id miss. your choices matter a lot.

Simply put those are not the type of game for me, i can get a few hours of enjoyment but then i lose interest, the story doesnt hold me, the gameplay gets repetitive, i dont care about the world im playing within.
With that said this game has sat in my steam library for probably 3 years picked up on sale without being played, for the exact above statements.  Sure I heard all the rave reviews but its just not my type of game right? Well i was so very very wrong. I am sure like many of you after watching the TV series my interest was once again peaked. I always wanted to start with witcher 1 and 2 but I could never make it farther than an hour or two in, the TV series gave me enough background info that I felt able to simply skip those games and I am sure glad I did. The story and world crafted in the game is leagues above anything else I have ever played. The sheer amount of things you can do, decisions you can make, side quests that appear simply by just walking down a city ally and being approached by a stranger that leads to a detailed intricate line of quests. It is all perfectly crafted to make a living world with characters and stories you honestly care about. Take my advice if anything about this story peaks your interest, and even if you are like me who could never seem to make it more than a few hours in to an open world game.

Maybe not because it has the best combat, or the most freedom of choice, not even the best graphics maybe?
But everything it has, is polished and well executed, and everything is in harmony.
The aspects i could take are:
- Gameplay: Simple mechanic of two buttons + spells, while also having the two swords. It would seem it's narrow, but the variety of enemies make you use the simple mechanics in A LOT of ways to defeat the great variety of enemies. It has really well done bosses and fights.
- Graphics: Polished and very beautifully crafted. It might not have the most realistic graphics for that year even, but it has a lot of detail, good lightning and textures.
- Bugs: In 2020, i can say they have patched them into oblivion.
- Story: It's a damn good story, but it has a downside. The main antagonists are not very well explained and shown. We don't know them enought to really have THAT impact. Everyone else in the story though, they have their share of background.
A very well executed and polished game, which is even today a standard for the genre.
I have only played the Main Story, and i'm eager to play the DLC soon.

There is surely no game that can top this one and it's to stay that way for a long time.
This game is practically perfect. Of course, when you make a game you can't reach perfection, not everyone will love this game, some people prefer Fortnite for instance.
But ! if you actually like good games, then this game is just for you.
This game was clearly designed for people who have good tastes, you won't make a normie play this game
but let me tell you more about the game. For this review is not about normies that have sh*t tastes but about the masterpiece that is The Witcher 3.
You play as Geralt of Rivia a Witcher. A Witcher is a monster slayer, a mutant. They have extreme strength and reflexes and use potions to get even stronger. And you follow his story, make impactful choices that change the course of the game and of course, slay monsters for coin.
The game has awesome graphics and was released in 2015. The gameplay is phenomenal. And the story... Oooh the story !
The story is perfect and the characters are amazing ! even the most despicable ones, the mean guys who make horrible actions are well written and you almost love them. Of course you don't love them for their evil side, you love them because the writing is perfect.
but let's rate the game now...
10/10 perfect game, perfect graphics, perfect story, perfect everything.

,2020-02-17,FALSE,,,,195.7,286,4,292030,76,TRUE,"This is THE best RPG i have played, the reasons for me making this claim are not without evidence.
One of the main reasons is the story which is jaw dropping, from white orchard to the swampy areas of Velen to the renowned city of Novigrad to the Great Witchers keep of Kaer Morhen, each area has its own decisions that will impact the way your story goes.
The game also has excellent replayability as the game has so so many choices, these range from impacting your game at the moment or in the far future, what build will you go, who will you side with, it can even be what hairstyle you want.
Second, is that the artstyle is still breathtaking to this day, from the monsters, buildings, people, and much more. All these things mend together to immerse you into the games astonishing setting and atmosphere. One thing i feel could have been improved apon was the hair.
Third, is the witcher contracts. this is because the witcher contracts arent just go here and kill this, they each have there small storys in them witch is just a +1 in the replayability of the game
Fourth is the gameplay in my opinion it is a huge improvement compared to the witcher 2, which had cluncky combat mechanics in my opinion, also in the Witcher 3 each fight seemed to have a soul as the excellent combat mechanics were woven with the incredible music of the witcher 3.
Fifth is the music, this is because no matter where you are, this could be, standing, running, riding, sailing, or fighting the music has a way to throw you into the beautiful but harsh world of the Witcher 3.
Last is the difficulty of the game, if its your first time and you just want the story than theres a difficulty for that, where as if you want a difficult challenge you can go DM (Death March) as i did and turn on upscaling
So this is the end of my review, i could keep going on about diagrams and more but i have laid out the main points in my opinion.",,Communist_Comrade,,,

1-Story telling: The strongest point by far of witcher 3 is easily its story telling. When side quest have better storyline and more engaging that 90% of rpgs main stories out there, you know you are in for a treat. Seriously, some of theses quests will haunt you.. in a good way, for a long long time.
2- World building: Red dead redemption came pretty much equal but only theses two games have such a believable world, you think its real.
3- Real choices and real consequences: You are not playing good or evil... forget this stupid concept. Like real life, you make choices and theses choices have consequences.. The consequences can be good according to you or evil according to your best friend... It is all but perception. You save a guy one day only to find out he was a criminal the second day? You let someone of dubious morale die and you find out the next day he could have cured cancer? Well, you do not know and you will not see it coming in witcher 3 either.  You make choices all the time.. so much it becomes very difficult to know when one will change the ending or does not change much in the end... and this is en excellent feeling. It feel real, it feel true.
In witcher 3, you might be in a puppet show but not once will you see the strings. Enjoy the ride.

,2020-02-17,FALSE,,,,40,287,4,292030,96,TRUE,"unpopular opinion
this game is good",,2x4 Pine Plank,,,
,2020-02-17,FALSE,,,,107.8,287,5,292030,107,TRUE,"OK, I've been hesitant as to how to really understand what  keeps me playing this game, because at times it's as open and interesting as Fallout, and other times it seems like it was written by a group of 13-year-olds really into Dungeons and Dragons. Ultimately I can say this, it's a fun game and worth slogging around in. BUT, if you're a veteran gamer, there are more plot holes and logic gaps than are really tolerable.
In general this is a vast improvement on the previous  Witcher games. The controls are good, the menus feel more comfortable, and the dozen plus keyboard shortcuts give this a hearty PC feeling, unlike the previous 2 games with felt like grinding console ports. There are some fantastic towns, ruins, caves, and terrain. In 54 hours of game play there are less than 5 interesting NPC's. That's the heart of the problem, right there.
Witcher 3 is a huge world, with hundreds of people, dozens of animals, even more monsters, a smooth combat system with great brutal kill effects. The story limps along with numerous distractions, the inconsistent idea of the nature and demeanor of a Witcher distracts from the character, and frequent lack of conversation options gets annoying. There are several times already that a major story plot is gaffed into something that makes very little sense, but the story moves on, leaving the mess behind without consequence. Not an error, not a glitch, just a lazy decision to leave something out that could explain what happened, rather than a ""Nothing to see here, move along"" feeling.
However, if you played games like Icewind Dale, Diablo, Fallout, or Grand Theft Auto V, you can find a big world to explore, things to do, and even find a few really amazing moments that are truly unique. However, if you want a story that's really going to grip you and not let go, this probably won't do the job. It's not F.E.A.R. or Half-Life. Granted, I'm old, but I really want something more from a game. Witcher 3 just seems half-finished, lacks focus, and ultimately falls short on making a really good game about ghosts and monsters and the mystic warrior who hunts them, instead flirting with confusing politics, loose magic rules, and far too many flat and boring quests from bland characters. Too bad.",,Apolyon,,,

Yeah there are a lot, but you don't have to select every dialogue if you don't want (it highlights the main ones in yellow).  Besides, I am finding the cut scenes to be absolutely amazing and hardly ever want to skip them!  If I do, I just read the sub-titles and then it allows me to hit space to skip.  Honestly though, I am not one to usually want to read everything but this game is making me want to since the story is so good.  I am finding myself reading all the books, reading about all the characters, and the beastiary.  The whole story and game is immersive and the way you have to use your Witcher senses and learn about your enemies to know to use against them is outstanding.  The fighting is very good, the magic is fun to use, and the monsters are awesome.
Simply an outstanding game. I hope they come out with another one after I finish this one.  If you are on the fence, just go ahead and buy it, I guarantee you won't be disappointed.

You can win fights by just slashing away at random, with the occasional defensive move or spell. It doesn't matter if you specialize towards melee, magic or potions, you can still win fights without any actual investment or effort, even on max difficulty. The only thing you need to worry about is not fighting enemies that are at a level much higher than your own, because a level 20 bandit is capable of slaying a
level 10 witcher, trained for battle and with decades of experience, with a single attack.
Your gear doesn't matter, because the gear you pick up off the ground is enough to carry you through the game, so no need for crafting. A ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• mace you pick off some dead bandit is somehow better than supposedly legendary swords you craft or obtain from quests, just because it's a higher level.
If you enjoyed the preparation aspect of previous witcher games, which is supposedly a big part of being a witcher, that aspect is gone. You can apply oils, drink potions and re-equip gear mid-fight, no preparation required.
The game has all these mechanics that could be interesting and engaging, but it isn't built with them in mind. It's built for you to blaze through it however you want to, just so you can experience the story and characters, which, to be fair, are the best part of the game. It's also got a ton of content, certain to keep you busy for a hundred of hours, if not more.

Needless to say, I have:
- Won a fistfight tournament
- Chosen a candidate to rule a nation (wont spoil!)
- Slain werewolves and many creatures
- Fished for 99999999999 amounts of sunken treasure on the isles of Skellige while enjoying the lore
- Climbed mountains and slided down tall ones, RAD STEEDZ BRO
- Romanced chicks (wont spoil also, play it for yourself also)
- Hunted for all armor diagrams
- Cleared all question marks in all 3 states, excluding the DLC ones

and so much more. the list goes on and on..
The main story? I rate it 10/10; the voice acting was superb, the music enhances the immersion and the combat system is quite unique (since it follows medival style fighting). Of course some actions led to some consequences, but i got the ending which I felt suit Geralt and Ciri.

For starters, from the first second you start the game, you are greeted with a cutscene detailing and building the world you are about to delve into. The fantasy setting fits the characters perfectly, with you playing as Geralt of Rivia, a witcher. He works well as a protagonist, because he isn't a blank slate for the player to impose themselves onto, but rather a deep and well thought-out character with internal conflicts of his own. The storytelling is immersive, allowing the player to make story-altering decisions and responses as Geralt to suit their own personality. Not only this, but the combat is fleshed out enough to allow the player to have their own playstyle. Want to craft oils and bombs to suit the enemy you are fighting? You can choose to do that, but it isn't necessary. Want to use magic to devastate the enemy? You can do that. The upgrades and glyph system allow players to form their own unique playstyle, and this makes the combat feel very rewarding.

So after you impossibly finished those 2 games or easily you choose to read the books which are telling the story of first 2 games , then now you are ready to play Witcher 3 , simple answer for a question you might be thinking at the moment ; Why read books of first 2 games but not Third one , answer is simple , gameplay , dialog selections , graphics of this game is literally awesome. I can't find the words to describe it even. So now you are ready to play Witcher 3 , first thing you gotta do is downloading 62 gbs if you bought the complete edition ( with dlcs) after that you'll be OK to play the game ( obviously ) . So here are some things you should know;
‚Ä?This is an RPG game which means you will have level and your enemies will also have levels and you will upgrade Geralt Of Rivia with skill points.
‚Ä?This game is fantastic which means it has Dragons , Vampires , Monsters , Elves etc. inside , if you didn't knew already ; just letting you know.
‚Ä?If you only succeed with Main Missions , you will lose lots of other stories. If you are a person which hates secondary missions , don't worry the game will make you play the side missions too , i promise.
‚Ä?After some time if you try to play the main story over and over you will get bored eventually so my advice is doing side missions , like really , they are not that bad and they are not repeating themselves , all of side missions has their own story even if they are really short.
‚Ä?This game has treasures too , if you are interested in that . ( looking for an item for 10 minutes )
‚Ä?You can go and have some *fun* with girls . Ofc if you pay it with coin.
So , my personal opinion about this game is ( i am an RPG hater )
I LOVE THIS GAME , LIKE REALLY.
i'd definitely advice you play this game and don't die before playin' it if you call yourself a gamer. Even main menu makes you enjoy , i mean it.
10 out of 10 in my own opinion.
Also this game has lots of languages so if you are not a english native nor main speaker it's literally OK , They do not have DUTCH for idfk what reason though..",,Shay,,,

The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt captures the storytelling and characters from the Witcher1 and makes it better, The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt captures the combat from Witcher2 and makes it better; it takes all that and puts it into an open world of incredibleness and quality.
in The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt whether you are doing a quest
The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt is a game that it wouldn't only be just something you play and forget about, it's something you play and never forget, Geralt himself and Roach; if the game only had Roach to walk around with and talk to that would be more than enough, but the story, the lore, the characters, the dialogues, the music...the MUSIC, the side quests, the monsters contracts, the treasure hunts, the open world, the Witcher gear,  the exploration, the crafting, the alchemy, AND Gwent the list goes on and on, all in all, to create a unique, magical, charming experience that I will always ever be so grateful to whatever thing that pointed me and told me the Witcher games are a thing.
I really felt upon finishing this game that part of me is missing, a part of my soul and being is gone,
a sad feeling that this life journey is over.

The animation is good.  The storyline seems solid.  The movement is annoying when trying to interract with a specific part of the environment.  You can't leave 3rd person, and Geralt won't turn on a dime, instead arcing just a bit when he turns around.

I originally played this game on PS4. I remember when I first got it, I played up until the Bloody Baron and then I lost interest. Started out a new game when the DLC was coming out and I was hearing great things. Instantly sucked a few hundred hours of my life. I thought back then this was the greatest game ever made.
I upgraded to a slightly newer PC that could actually run the game and decided to give the game another go after watching the Netflix series. For a game that is almost 5 years old, this is still the best game ever made. It has aged a little and the the combat isn't as seamless as other games that have been released since; however it is still the pinnacle of story-telling. This is high fantasy and the game/story is massive. I think people that don't like the game couldn't get into it and found the story/lore confusing. I hope the Netflix series can get people into this game and book series more; because the Witcher is an amazing story and should be considered a major rival to the LOTR-universe.

,2020-02-15,FALSE,,,,5.4,318,3,292030,315,FALSE,"Waow... I have no words.
What an absolute waste of time and money.
Okay okay, so: First off, I've tried playing The Witcher 1... didn't even get past the tutroial, so that set a bar for me right from the start. Now I've heard so many great things about The Witcher 3 through the years, but I kept my distance because of an extremely bad and unsatifying experience.
With that said, I decided to give The Witcher 3 a try... and oh boy do I regret everything about it.
First thing that messes with me is the mouse sensitivity, either you put that thing ALL the way down and make navigation in menus insufferably slow, but your camera doesn't fly round when you're in character mode... or you just have 2000% motion blur all the time, but are able to normally navigate menus.
So... Actually starting a new game! Now, as a brand new player to the series, I went all in on the tutorials, getting things explained and shown, little did I know I would have to sit and just read for  hours before the game itself even started... or well, the games tutorial started. at this point I was already considering whether this was worth it, since this lowered every expectation I already had... I mean how can I be expected to remember all this stuff with no way of getting it explained again unless I have to break the pace of the game, minimize it and google stuff?
So getting to moving around... barely, every time I move what seems no more then 10 meters, there's a new pop-up giving me another ""this is important, you do it like this, which will affect the world you play in"" generic message. Cool choices matter, I get that by now.
So (extremely) slowly and with a ton of pauses because of explanations, I FINALLY get to the combat section of the tutorial. And what do I get... never before have I had to read that much to understand a combat system. I could go on about the wall of text new players are met with.
After finnishing reading more stuff about this minor obscure detail in combat, I get to the actual thing... It's worse than Skyrims system. Extremely clunky, free-targeting-city unless you choose one specific target... which somehow always ends up in the back ranks so you might as well retarget, and suddenly, that target is in the back ranks... oh my lord. At this point I'm about ready to give up, Heavily discouraged by what feels like The Shakespere Collection in text, that has to be read and understood, and utter stupidity in combat systems. But I press on becuase there has to be some light at the end of this tunnel.
Welcome to the actual game itself. Now please have en eternaty of go-here-do-this quests with absoultly no diversity. And if you wanna defeat this foe you've never seen before... guess what, you have to break the pace of the game, stop combat and read even more about how to even damage a Noonwraith.
So at an all-time low in-game, I decide to try to get some more exp so I can be at least somewhat useful... Oh wait, let's pause the game becuase, during the tutorial we didn't make you read about skill points, brewing potions or weapon durability.
Just great...
After actually giving up on reading and just wanting to mess around, I slam my space button and just skip it, deciding to figure it out at some point when I really need it.
So finally leaving the starting... town? I suddenly encounter an enemy that's no more then TWO WHOLE LEVELS above me... and suddenly all of my attacks are reduced by 90% in damage... Are you actually for real?... Fine whatever... I'll flee and come back later... but oh wait, your health is low and you can only heal by eating food which is horrendously slow... Now please be attacked by 8  Drowners at the same time, which all stun you and kills you... and btw you didn't save so please redo all your missions.
I finally just gave up and closed the game.
So what did I learn.
- Unless you're willing to come out of the game with a PHD in Witcher stuff, don't open it up.
- Whatever you try to do, assume you have to read about it in some random book, stupid pop-up or your journal.
- Combat is insanely clunky, even if you side roll enemies still hit you and you lose 1/3 of your HP from lesser monsters... You never ever have the chance to counter attack because of sheer numbers disadvantage... And why do I have to choose between 2 different swords to even damage propperly (This should be something that comes naturally... not something a player should activly choose)
- Story is very unimmersive and flat. at least the tiny bits I got to ""experience"" (Seriously, just 2 edge-lrods in some tavern)
- There are so many systems that are so extremely confusing to new players, that they don't even bother learning them
- The leaning curve in this game just requires you to be a working at NASA.
- Unless you can connect a controller, the game is insufferable with mouse and keyboard.
- The game, AT LEAST, uses a nice color palette.
Edit: Having taken a small breather and looking at the review again, I have to say: I've completly lost any interest in gaming as a whole for the rest of the day. I really have to force myself to keep a propper tone and not curse left and right. My hands are almost shaking and I have to keep taking deep breaths and remind myself that ""It's just a game""... That's how insufferable and frustrating this game is.",,Crow Valentine,,,

I recommend playing on the hardest difficulty: learning to become a competent witcher is not easy (it makes the start of the game very hard), but there is a rhythm to combat that will let you consistently survive, and I found it fun to hold myself to a high bar knowing that death was always a few missteps away.

BUUUUUUUT there are a couple mods I recommend installing just for quality of life improvements.
---If you have a display driver crash (frequently Open GL) just turn off g-sync/ v-sync
1-Fast Travel From Anywhere- This mod feels essential.  However I recommend playing through the game once without it just so you can get the full immersive gameplay.
2-Custom bets in gwent games - not necessary, but I felt that if Garalt has the coin why not let him bet all his money on 1 round of gwent, F-it  why not.
3-Run/Jump in shallow water - I am not sure if this was actually added to the base game or not, but I always have it installed since its just stupid to think that a witcher cannot jump or move faster than a slow walk while in shallow water

For a game made in 2015 it still holds up really well graphically and gameplay-wise.
The main issue regarding some open world games is that some parts of it feel dead. This is not the case with Witcher 3 as every community, even the forests and seas have their own form of life and culture.
You have choice in this game as well, and whilst you can go about killing everyone, you would also feel the same satisfaction from not killing and befriending someone that could have been your enemy.
The RPG element is also properly fleshed out to make your character strong but not so strong that it makes the game overly easy. It it worth noting that it does have a learning curve but once it is figured out, you can build the main character to suit your play-style.
The amount of attention to detail in this game feels like they made the game and let it marinate by having playtesters.
Some games you get tired of the UI and the game mechanics, but in Witcher 3, you can interact in so many different ways, it takes really long before it gets repetitive.
Lets talk about the music. This game's soundtrack is definitely one of the best ever. I have even began listening to the music on YouTube when trying to do other work-related tasks.
Different locations have soundtracks that relate to the culture of the people there.
The voice acting. What can I say but it is spot on. There is also humor blended throughout the voice acting. For example, when you run through crowds of NPCs and bump into them they make funny remarks or weird sounds.
There were some bugs in the game however. I have encountered a few with Roach running down hill but nothing was game-breaking or affecting my actual gameplay. These bugs were hilarious and added to the humor characteristic of the game to me.
Overall, I recommend trying out this game and even though you might be overloaded with the gameplay mechanics at first, just give it 2 hours. I am looking forward to what CD Projekt Red is doing for their future games.",,SystemRichie,,,

,2020-02-15,FALSE,,,,126.7,325,9,292030,31,TRUE,"What does it take, in my humble opinion, to be the best game? Is it the fun factor? Is it the moment to moment gameplay, happening while we‚Äôre playing and nothing else? Is it how interesting the concept is? Or is it the story, the world and the people of our games? Or is it something else?
Maybe it‚Äôs everything. Maybe it‚Äôs how the game makes us feel or how it impacts us on a personal level and on the gaming industry as a whole. I could have chosen a lot of games that fit these criteria such as God of War or Skyrim, two games which I have enjoyed and will continue to enjoy endlessly. But in the end, I‚Äôd have to choose The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.
Now I didn‚Äôt pick The Witcher 3 cos it‚Äôs anywhere near perfect, any one as soon as they boot up the game can realise there is something deeply wrong with the control system, it‚Äôs clunky, stiff and downright awkward indoors, moving through small houses, alleyways and doors is a pain the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô? Moving in combat can feel inelegant due to soft lock-on. Take Roach out on some bumpy terrain or up a rocky mountain and you‚Äôll end up with a migraine. The controls are unruly and unyielding, and you‚Äôll basically hit every object you can.
The Wild Hunt and Nilfgaard are also really underdeveloped. We never really see Nilfgaards diversity in culture, which is mentioned in the books. In The Witcher 3 it seems they are only there as invaders for narrative purposes, you will have to go far out of your way to learn anything about them of substance and still then it‚Äôs not that much, the same goes for The Wild Hunt. Both groups are missing a degree of characterisation you‚Äôd expect, especially since the rest of the game is so rich. Considering The Witcher 3 is not a game of black and white, The Wild Hunt is depicted as a generic evil. Ask yourself, who‚Äôs your favourite villain in The Witcher 3? I highly doubt you‚Äôd say Eredin.
Onto combat. Is it great? I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs bad, but it‚Äôs definitely not the best part of the game. It can be clunky, and it does not flow very well on the whole. The alchemy system is not as influential and can be seen as an afterthought especially on easier difficulties, and the game overall is not that hard. Even on Deathmarch I barely felt I was in danger even against the toughest of foes.
Now you might be thinking, ‚ÄúHow is this his favourite game when he‚Äôs literally ripped into it for 3 paragraphs?‚Ä?Well it‚Äôs simple really, every game has its flaws, even the best of games. Some games take their flaws to the grave, eaten alive by the disproportion of the frequency, but The Witcher 3 does not. It is a game that has a stunningly amount of care put into making the story and the world and the immersion feel unforgettable, its dynamic and thought provoking, full of choices and densely packed with twist, turns and nods to prior games. At every corner something interesting seems to happen, A Tower of Mice, Where the Wolf and Cat play, No Place Like Home, Paperchase and so many more interesting quests, not presented in some generic way though, but complicated, cloudy and very different, especially the cast.
Imagine reading the Bloody Baron synopsis on a sheet of paper: Alcoholic man, hurts family and seeks forgiveness for what he‚Äôs done. Not the most original idea is it? I‚Äôm sure every one of us has seen the same scenario in some form, whether it be tv series, book or another game, looking to portray the same emotions and character, but does it turn out any other way than you expect? Does it ever get as twisted and knotty and morbid as in The Witcher 3? A simple troupe turned multi-hour spiderweb of intricate detail, full of immediate player choice in the matter, with no one ending up the same in the end, whatever road they take. It hits on every emotional peak and valley and it‚Äôs only one questline in the game. How about this headline? Woman plays love song in a tavern. Or Ciri? It‚Äôs the classic Chosen One on the run troupe.
The framework of The Witcher 3 is quite basic, but it‚Äôs intention and presentation are extraordinary. Content has an amazing amount of characterisation and intricacy, taking you into these beautiful lands full of strange faces and interesting things to see, these characters have real stories, many of which the player can partake in, often influence outcomes as well. How can you not care, when so much work has been put in the game? Even the monsters, gross as they may be, are not black and white. Werewolves with feelings, Vampires, are they friends or foes? Mutants we might pity and more, even a ghost in a tree has a developed story. If you find something in The Witcher 3, chances are that it is well fleshed out and exciting, unlike most other titles. It can be incredibly engrossing to those willing to dive off into the deep end, into The Witcher 3‚Äôs tale, as you learn so much about why you are playing and what it means to the people in it.
It‚Äôs got many flaws, as I mentioned earlier, but they don‚Äôt detract from the immersion. It is a beautiful game, an enchanting adventure and a complicated masterpiece, with some flaws which you can easily ignore, when all is said and done.",,King Kurtus,,,

+ Consistently decent and interesting writing. Particularly exceptional in the DLCs.
+ DLCs, both free and paid, are simply outstanding. There is a clear improvement in quality in the expansions.
+ Fascinating world and lore. Once again thanks to the source material as well as CDPR's intuition.
+ Incredible atmosphere.
Graphics - Notably the tree and foliage models.
Highly original and exceptional soundtrack. Notably Kaer Morhen, Whispers of Oxenfurt, The Mandragora, and much more.
+ Surprisingly hilarious. An example being the
+ Fantastic modding scene. (Though there are limitations).
+ Runs smoothly.
- MAJOR ISSUE: Geralt selectively uses Axii (mind influencer) and his (superhuman) witcher senses for plot convenience. This issue is apart of the underlying defect within the entire Witcher universe where magic and worldbuilding do not have distinct identities/defined limitations. This can mostly be attributed to Andrzej Sapkowski's disregard for his own universe. Unlike that of J.R.R. Tolkein or even George R. R. Martin, Sapkowski is known to view the world as a mere means to an end. (That end being the story and characters.)
- Occasional poor writing.
Arnvald from the quest 'King's Gambit' is written terribly.
... and more.
- Ubiquitous and hilarious 'Ludonarrative Dissonance'.
- Inappropriate/awkward use of music. CDPR needs to learn how to insert their music with subtlety and finesse.
- The occasional but nevertheless jarring ultra low-quality animation.
- Combat fails to be engaging and skills are not balanced - Enemy upscaling is the only way to keep the game challenging, even on Death March difficulty.
- Dismembering humans causes the limb/body part that was cut off to instantly morph into limb/body part of a default model.
- Lacks Polish, mostly in terms of movement, especially on Horses.
- Extremely low-resolution texture work on various objects as well as highly cartoonish blood textures.
- Unrealistic terraforming in the base game. (Slightly improved in Blood and Wine.)
- Downgrades.
- Cut content.
Iorveth does not make his reappearance.
Graden is severely unexplored. A great opportunity to explore a witch hunter's perspective.
- Minor bugs.
Whispering Hillock still whispers after being tended to.

Not a lot can be said about this game that hasn't been said already, but here we are:
*POTENTIAL SPOILER AHEAD*
Having played the first two games, I was keen to get into the story of the third one. Friends had told me about how epic this game was, and I was hesitant to really believe it until my first play-through. The main story is about the same length as the first two games combined (roughly 80 hrs) if you complete all of the side missions. Then there are the DLCs, which are fantastic expansions of the original story and should definitely be played if you enjoy the main story.
I ran the game on the lowest settings at the time I write this, but even with the worst options possible, It still looked fantastic. New features such as the fast travel and the ability to ride a horse were vast improvements on the first two games.
The attention to detail within the world is excellent. The choices you make can alter things such as the NPC dialogue, or character's actions after a specific choice in a quest is made. I bought all three games + DLC in a sale for ¬£20 and I can honestly say it is one of the best buys you will ever make for a game franchise. Easily re-playable thanks to the multiple outcome possibilities available. You will either spend 1 hour on this game and not enjoy it, or spend hundreds of hours on it and never stop discussing it.

Recently, I decided to give it another try. This time, I wanted just wanted to explore and experience the world. I talked to interesting characters, helped them with interesting problems, read the lore and bestiary, and accidentally found my passion for witcher alchemy. A little patience on the main story, and I was blown away: The world is dark, sure, but it is rich. Each side quest, each each, each self-made quest for alchemical reagents is beautiful, natural storytelling. The fights are challenging, but fair. The stories are emotional and complex. The cities feel massive and alive. It doesn't feel like everyone is just there for your benefit -- they couldn't care less about you, except maybe to spit and sneer at the mutant freak.

There are two things, which carry this game to its high praise. Its graphics and narrative. The writing, the camera work and the aesthetic manage to pull you into an amazing experience. This game will be worth your time, if you're willing to forgive the gameplay, bugs and horrible balancing. I have bought this game twice, once as a hardcopy in the store (gog-copy) and once with all the DLC's on Steam. I have gotten every achievement on both platforms, played every diffuculty, every dialogue option and every sidequest, contract and even point of interest. I played through it 6 times with a total of around 300 hours. So believe me, when I say, the difficulty settings are horrible, weak mobs are too strong and the bosses comparably weak. You'll have far more trouble against 3 drowners than against the main boss of the game and everyone in between. The AI is also terrible, which will become clear after the second fistfight you engage in and the houses, where you're forced to fight in, are not designed to be fought in. The surrounding rarely impacts the fight negatively, but since there are two instances, where you're obligated to fight, you'll be even more frustrated. After having visited all the points of interest, I can say, with full convidence, that there are not enough big monsters to fight, so I advise you to, at some point, enable the console if you're feeling up for a fight. Also, the environment has a broken collision system. You're horse will get stuck on small slaps, branches or randomely stop. You'll sometime die, when jumping off a ledge, even though you'd survived it 10 minutes ago from a higher ground. There are some objects even missing collision and you'll pass right through them (most of them on the coasts of Ard Skellig). The hit-reg system is random too, sometimes enemies will hit you at the very start of their animation, other times they should hit you, but do not. The range is also buggy and deviates from the mobs animation. Your companions can killsteal, meaning, they can kill a mob and you won't get the xp for killing it. Which is frustrating, when your long awaited level up is postponed (nit-picky, but still worth mentioning). But still, after all of those points, it's still the best game I have ever played. As I said, the writing carries this game, as well as the graphics. I knew every monster, every main character and every location, after having played it twice. I even listened to some soundtracks every now and then. I got so much joy out of this game, that I can only say, you have to buy it, you have to play it. That's the best journey I have ever been through. 10/10",7.65612E+16,Dephite,,,

Not only is the game around 50 hours long (took me around 45 to see the credits roll, but I was ignoring a few side quests), it also has a couple very long and enjoyable DLCs that offered 30 or so hours of additional gameplay.

,2020-02-13,FALSE,,,,121.9,343,3,292030,239,TRUE,"This game for a while was sitting in my library but I finally got around to playing it. The story and the atmosphere design over all is just purely 10/10 material. You get a lot for your money here even the DLCs are over 10-15hours long and longer if you do all the side quests; this is especially true for blood and wine. I still haven't finished blood and wine but I see an overwhelming amount of value for my money only 6 hours in. The DLCs are definitely worth a purchase it just adds to the game.
Lets get into some negatives though:
1: This game only has one major shortcoming in my opinion which isn't surprising to most who have played it; the combat could use some work. Due to the combat being a bit weak I can see a lot of people not playing through the first 10-15hours. However later on with signs and bombs and oils you can make it more interesting. Also a lot of modifications available to help adjust the combat if you feel necessary on the nexusmods. Some complain it being to easy or hard at first the truth of that is it starts hard then once you pass the first 5-10levels and get some gear it becomes easy on any difficulty. This is enough talking about the combat over all its definitely the weakest link of the game but doesn't ruin it in my opinion.
2: Another fault of the game I can think of is the awkward placement of higher level monsters and enemies throughout the game. At first starting off you might be urged to explore the beautiful world in this game. However once you do you might notice at first you run into monsters and enemies 10+ levels higher than you and end up killing you in a single blow. This is a major issue in my opinion in an adventure game and isn't forgivable but this does get better if you stay on track with the quest log and is avoidable.
But enough about the faults as I said above in the header - the game has a lot of beautiful 10/10 material for you to enjoy. The story telling is amazing and the environment is definitely worth exploring and going back to, I encourage you to explore once you have the gear for it or over level the zone there are a lot of hidden quests as well.
In summary or TL;DR - Witcher 3 is a content packed game with high quality storytelling and beautiful environment to explore with a lot of replay value. It has a shortcoming in combat design and zone balancing but is easily overcome by just following the path and paying attention to quests levels. Anyone looking for a very good RPG adventure this game is definitely worth every bit of the money + the DLC. It gets a very solid 9/10 for me with a very solid recommendation - you will definitely get 100+ hours of enjoyment out of this one.",,Meki,,,

Everything from the main story to the side content to the overall tone itself just fell flat.  When it wasn't boring, it was utterly predictable.  The open world gameplay was a terribly scaled, nightmare slog that I quickly lost interest in.  Most every enemy I fought, most every quest I accepted, and most every recipe, schematic, or piece of equipment I found was wildly above my level.  This game actively, derisively tries to kick your teeth in if you engage with its core loop.  I have never played a game - never mind a AAA, year defining game - that so completely and incomprehensibly botched both the scaling of its content and its core rewards system.
The problem is so pronounced that it discourages you from delving into literally a third of its skill tree.  I found zero use for alchemy because every bomb recipe I ever found was for the orbital thermonuclear variant where I couldn't even make the Fisher-Price Baby's First Bomb version.  Same goes for the potions and weapon oils.  Crafting was similarly useless.  I never found a weapon or armor recipe under level 20.  And I was being rewarded these things at level 1...
I was ready to give up shortly after getting to Velen and encountering level <SKULL SKULL THREAT LEVEL ALPHA DANGER> enemies in every direction.  The combat is so one-dimensional and tedious that it's possible to kill the bandit that's 35 levels higher than you, but its absurdly tedious.  Difficulty is simulated by giving enemies entirely too much health, endless parry bars, and attacks that take a third of your health.  Definitely makes you feel like the witcher badass the game keeps crowing about...
I only continued playing, after downloading a mod to fix the absurd scaling, because I found the overall grimdark tone of the game to be so ineptly presented, that it was actively comical.  Most of the quest content beats you over the head continuously with the theme that Witcherworld is filled exclusively with lying, selfish, degenerate ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•s.  You will do no good in Witcherworld.  You will stir the garbage because there is only garbage and you are garbage.  I'd say 90% of the game's content could be distilled down to a general script:
1. Person A hires you to kill a monster that killed their best friend ever, person B
2. In the monster's secret clubhouse, you find person B, still clinging to life
3. They reveal that Person A betrayed them and is secretly a war criminal who ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô?29 women
4. You return and kill Person A
5. In their diary, you find the entry: ""The ballad of how Person B is a war criminal who ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô?29 more women than I ever ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô?",,,,,
6. Person B escapes - oh you dumb merciful donkey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is funny for a while, but when it gets old, the game just crashes.  I made it through the main quest for Velen and Novigrad before traveling to Skellige.  When I opened the map and saw an entire new continent filled with question marks and yellow notice boards and even more of a soulless main story, I just wanted to quit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So I quit.  And I have no interest in how the story resolves.  I don't care about any of the mystery around the wild hunt or the weirdo masked elf guy or Ciri or any of it.  It's a rare piece of fiction where even my OCD will whisper """"yeah"," you can go ahead and quit here...I'm good.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As someone who's not a fan of fantasy games (bar Zelda), I was incredibly sceptical about The Witcher, regardless of how many people had recommended the game to me. Zelda is somewhat the exception to the rule for me, as I've played it since my childhood, I've got a fondness of the game and the entire universe within. I had always thought that as fantasy games go, Zelda would be the only one to really catch my eye.
The Witcher 3 changed this completely. This game not only has hundreds of hours of playable content, it's exciting, rewarding as you progress through, the expansion pass adds a new city to explore and delve into and every step of the entire game is fantastic. Character progression is great, upgrading Geralts kit, everything about it made me want to play more. I can't say more good things about this game.

The story is phenomenal, the characters are lovable the mechanics feel really solid, and its just all around beautiful (if you've got a rig that can handle it.)
This is game design at it's finest!!  However, I have a few problems with the main questline.  At times the repetitive nature can be rather tiresome at times.  But overall, its worth playing through fully because it's really exciting.  The side/witcher quests really make up for the repetitive-ness of it. There's so much story to be discovered and so many monsters to fight.
My other gripe is, for me, not having played any of the other witcher games, the ability upgrade system felt rather overburdensome.  There's so many options for upgrades that it's hard to choose what to go with.  But once you get to a certain level, you should have enough various upgrades that you can swap certain ones in and our depending on your situation.
I cannot put into words how much fun this game is.  I feel as though it should still be listed as a $60 game even five years after release.  At the same time, you shouldn't feel like you need to get it immediately, its worth to wait for a sale, especially if it's bundled with the dlc(s).  Which are insanely good and I'll post a review on each one in the future.

It's a great game, but you don't need me to tell you that - many other reviewers have given it the thumbs-up.  It's beautiful, immersive, gripping, dramatic, funny, moving.  The expansions are good too, I recommend the whole kit and kaboodle.
It has its issues - swimming/underwater is frequently annoying, but perhaps that works to make risky diving actually seem like a feat to pull off.  Targeting is frequently a bit dodgy (played with a controller).  Inventory management, even with the stash, is frequently tedious, and the stash was just exceedingly slow to access with any modest amount of stuff in there.  The game is huge; so much stuff to do.  If you just play to churn through everything to finish everything I suspect it would largely feel like a chore, but switching attitude to just enjoying the various adventures and sidetracks along the way makes it quite a different experience.  Quite a few of the secondary quests are meaty enough to be savoured on their own merits without worrying about how it gets you to ""the end"".  Not all of them - there's a bunch of nothing quests and stories with potential that perhaps just aren't realized very well.  But there's so much good stuff here that I find it impossible to be negative about this experience.

(self to note, the game has a good story, thats not the bad part)
The introduction of the game was good. The option for if you want the basics of the combat and magic casts or not was a good thing.
I got hooked into the game, but the more I progressed, the less I wanted to play it.
I travled into the town with my companion, then some cutscenes then I got my first objective.
I began exploring the town, meet some guards that didnt liked I drawed my sword. I liked that thing, it adds some immersion I gotta say. But then I accidently stole an item in front of  a npc in his hero. He didnt react, then I thought, why didnt I get accussed of stealing. Then I stole another item, another, another and so on. No consequenses there.
Also NEVER scare a npc or a kid. They make your ears bleed with same scream nearly on every npc. For the womans scream as an example, it really sounds like the same voice actor on all of the womans who are not part of the story. Even with the kids, when they yell. It sounds like this. ARRRH iggghhhh, ARRRRRGHHHH,ARRRH iggghhhh, ARRRRRGHHHH. Rinse and repeat with no delay between the sounds of the screams.
Also a noteable mention is selecting objects like fire candles or even a bag to loot. It is a nightmare to select objects with the camera. In first person  wouldnt had been a problem, but it can also be done good in third person.
I had to pick an note up, but there were people standing near the table which means that you can talk with them or rather they tell you something. But by all means, the way you speak with them is the SAME freaking key you use to interact with. Ofcouse it would be the same, but I had to get the perfect angle on the camera. It took some time, but it did not end there, I had issues with that exact problem in many other places.
The combat was also a bit meh
Also not to mention micro stuttering when moving the mouse. Other posts I read that it goes back to 2015 where the game was released, where the issue also present. Feels like a console game, because zero issues on a controller on 2 different machines.
Heres some links that confirms that issue and is still present
Game is marked as a Open world, RPG, Story Rich game and masterpiece according to Steam in the tags.
The game after my own opinion dosent have the RPG(RolePlayingGame) elements as stealing something with no consequenses. Game is also marked as atmospheric, well.. not with these screaming npcs with only 3 sounds on them.
Marked as a masterpiece. It has issues, that is game breaking for me. When using the mouse and keyboard, is a no go, controller is needed for a smooth experience, selecting objects is a nightmare.
All this I mentioned so far. I have not yet found any reviews writing about this so far. Game is a true masterpiece. Well it has some issues that is present

Results of your very own choices are not for a few different dialogues. In fact your choices create a new atmosphere of relationships between many various characters.
The story is absolutely phenomenal and it is also where the game shines at most. Sure, the environment is good, but there is no chance it's perfect. Bugs are unfortunately unavoidable. With animation errors and bugs I don't see the world worth to be immediately fully explored. Repetitive undiscovered tasks are swarmed in almost every location imaginable, therefore it is not necessary to explore the world before taking quests. Take your quest first and explore the world for the undiscovered tasks then, that way you can actually have fun and complete your quests at the same time.
At first I didn't like it. To me it felt like every open world game that is doomed with its repetitive combat system and missions. However as soon as I start investing more hours into the game I got immediately hooked on by its adventurous story. I wanted to know what happens next, I wanted to know how my ""relationship"" with other characters evolves. Game does that well, hence why I couldn't stop playing the game for a whole week.
For the combat system to be fun you need to study your enemies. Investigate their weaknesses, then apply specific oils to your sword, use various bombs or simply abuse attack & dodge technique (but using that technique you will get nothing but a damage sponge match).
Try to overcome the game's first experience as I know it is not the strongest perk of the game. After some hours you will most likely be addicted to the game and will not make a single step out of your room.",,Surreal Baby,,,

,2020-02-12,FALSE,,,,54.5,357,3,292030,262,TRUE,"I finally got a chance to play The Witcher 3, and I must say it lives up to the hype.  This game does a fantastic job at pulling you into the world and giving you reasons to keep exploring it. The game does a great job of taking you on an epic adventure throughout the main story.  The lore, the characters, and towns all flesh out the journey in way that few other games have.
As someone who has not played through the Witcher 1 nor the Witcher 2, I feel like the game's story works well on it's own. You play as Geralt of Rivia, a witcher. A witcher is basically a group of humans that undergo mutations through potions and most see them as mutants. They were created for combat and they take out monsters throughout the land for money, usually. They are a dying breed because they stopped creating more because the whole process of creating them was completely unethical.
The story starts with Geralt as he is looking for Yennifer, a sorceress he has known for a long time. It develops quickly from there and takes you down a winding path filled with all sorts of humans, dwarfs, elves, and monsters. Without spoiling anything, I absolutely loved the ending to this game - there are multiple endings as well. There is a specific relationship Geralt builds throughout the game and I think it really makes the ending (that I got) great.
I would be remiss, if I didn't bring up Gwent. Gwent is the in universe card game and at first I didn't want to get into it. But I decided to do a quest related to it and next thing you know, I spent a handful of hours playing everyone that would play me to build a good deck. To give the very basics: You get 10 cards, you play cards on the board for points. You need the most points in 2 out of the 3 rounds to win. Simple concept, but even with a good deck there are no guarantees.
The combat in the game is more than that of a simple hack and slash. If you try to play this like Dynasty Warriors you will die quickly to basic monsters early on. You need to be blocking, parrying and/or dodging enemies to survive. You also have some handy tools that make fights much easier. You can use some basic magic, potions that heal or boost damage, and oils that can boost damage. Preparing for the specific enemies at hand can make life much easier, but I did find that I could make it through battles without preparation on the normal difficulty.
I did not get a chance to play the DLC fully yet, but the parts I have played have been really good so far. Also you can get some really good Gwent cards with it, so don't miss out on those.
Overall, everyone who said this game was great back when it came out in 2015 were right. I am glad I finally got a chance to play through it and consider it to be one of the best games I have played to date. If this type of game interests you at all, I encourage you to take some time and play The Witcher 3.",,H2O Hero,,,

It‚Äôs clear from playing it how much love CDPR poured into this project. W3 boasts an absolutely overwhelming amount of content that maintains a refreshingly high average level of quality.
One aspect of W3 I particularly enjoyed was how many morally grey decisions there were to make. The world in this series is not black and white. Sometimes being a hero makes things worse in the end. Sometimes a monster deserves death even if it meant no harm. Sometimes you have to decide what the lesser evil is. Decisions in W3 constantly kept me thinking and rationalizing my actions.
With an incredibly lovable cast of characters, an intriguing storyline that your decisions affect, an amazing soundtrack, stunning visuals, fun and complex gameplay, I never tired of The Witcher 3 throughout its entire multi-hundred hour tenure. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy, as I think almost anyone can find something to love in the rich world provided.
I should also say that the expansions for Witcher 3 feel like just that: expansions. The Witcher 3 by itself is absolutely a complete game and they are not essential. They are, however, undeniably worth it. Hearts of Stone is a smaller expansion with a story that I would say is the best quest line in the game. Blood and Wine is massive and easily adds 40+ hours to the game at least. The Game of the Year edition is worth the small amount of extra money you pay.
Note that potential new players should recognize that this is the 3rd game in a series that is also preceded by several books. While Witcher 3 can be played standalone and understood just fine, I do recommend familiarizing yourself with the world by reading some summaries of, at least, Witcher 1 and 2 beforehand so you won‚Äôt feel so lost immediately upon starting the game. Oftentimes Geralt and his companions reminisce on past events that have happened that a completely new player wouldn‚Äôt understand.
PS: if you buy it, be careful about playing Gwent. You might get sucked into playing a deceptively addicting card minigame for 20 hours in which case Witcher 3 takes a hard change and becomes a Pok√©mon game in which you are maddeningly dedicated to finding every card you can to boost your deck and win every tournament in the land.

Play the damned side quests. They're worthwhile, and often absolutely outlandish with all the absurdities of the world and strange people.

If a side quest is better than many many main quests in other games then you know the developers are definetly one, if not the best out there if it comes to this. I didnt play any previous Witcher games, and neither did i read any of the books about the universe but i think the world building is absolutely amazing, the characters are often not at all one sided and you yourself have to choose many diffcult decisions.
The first time i played this game (about 2 years ago) i didnt enjoy it, simply because i wasnt able to step into this world and take it all in, however i recently decided to give it another try and i didnt regret it. with 33.2 hours in my current playthrough i know there is a lot more to come and i know that i will have fun with the game till the last second.
To round it up: If some bugs and glitches here and there dont annoy you too much and if you like RPG games then why dont you already have this game ? The developers are one of the few that are trustworthy and i am hyped for cyberpunk 2077 but until its released i will make sure to finish this masterpiece.

That being said, and in fairness, I'll list the pros and cons of this game.
CONS
- The combat, levelling, and alchemy systems feel a bit clunky and overwhelming when you first begin the game, and as a result can make getting into it a bit difficult.
- The mapping system is a bit wonky at times and can glitch out and not lead you in the best direction.
- The horse is probably the most overtly terrible part about this game. Numerous animation glitches that trigger fairly easily, an unintuitive summoning system that can result in the horse spawning in inaccessible locations, being unable to get to you do to the horse AI being unable to navigate tight terrain on its own, and a rather janky feeling riding system that is a bit too sensitive (some of those issues might be with my controller in fairness)
- Animations can at times look a bit janky, especially facial animations and I haven encountered a few rendering/cutting issues in cutscenes, but overall it's not too bad.
PROS
- The game is just stunning. This is easily one of the prettiest games I have ever played.
- Combat and systems. Once you understand the combat, crafting, and alchemy systems of the game they feel veery satisfying.
- The story of this game is very well written and the choices you make in game feel impactful, not only for the ending but for the world around you.
- The map is enormous and has loads of things on the side for you to explore.
- The Witcher Contracts are some of the most fun quests in the game. Really puts you in the shoes of the title of witcher as opposed to just telling you you hunt monsters for coin and never actually letting you do so.

Back 4-5 years ago, my brother told me that this new game called ""The Witcher 3"" was coming out, me being the stupid idiot I am, I just said ""oh cool"" and did nothing more with the information I had required.
Until the Netflix Witcher series came out.
From that moment, I knew what I must do. I bought the game during the Winter sales, for ‚Ç?4.99 and it's the best ‚Ç?4.99 I've spent in my life.
This game captures it all, the wonder and awe of exploring the highest peaks and the deepest oceans, the fear of being chased by something you know can cut you down with ease, the happiness of conquering said beast, the enchantment of participating in ""The Witcher Trade"" and hunting down the nearest monster or bandit camp, but most importantly this game captures the essence of family and the never ending, impossibly irreplaceable love that binds people together.
I came into this game with the highest of expectations, and not once was I dissapointed, time and time again this game excelled and excelled, setting the bar higher and higher for the next quest or fight, and every time it met that bar, and smashed it to smitherines.

At points, I found bugs or slight texture problems, but nothing critical or nothing game-breaking. The only time I needed to force restart the game, my character of Geralt simply froze in combat, and could not and would not move, and upon dying, the game continued on as if I was alive.
This game honestly has it all, and if you, reader, are considering buying this game and giving it a whirl, I can only suggest it with the highest recommendation I can possibly give.

For me it was at the end of the Novigrad part of main storyline, but what mattered even more is that I didn't get there in the fastest way possible.
You really must give a chance to all aspects of the game. Some might seem obsolete at first, like oils, potions and alchemy in general, but within time you realise that in certain situations those can actually help you a lot.
As opposed to Skyrim, loot doesn't have a stationary armor/damage rating, but instead goes along with your level. So 90% of the stuff you find will be either better than what you currently have, or just a small bit worse (unless it's a really really common enemy drop such as bandits, but in chests and while exploring the situation is guaranteed). This leads to the fact that you actually feel glad that you found new loot, while in Skyrim you were technically able to get near top tier loot very early if you knew the proper locations, which made the rest of the looting in game often unneccessary or boring.
One thing I've seen people mention with this comparison is the fact that they feel like they're watching a movie rather than being the character. This is debatable and again, I'd say it comes mostly from the fact that you didn't go deep enough into the story. Skyrim gives you the chances to be on top of almost every faction, guild, brotherhood and all such things in the game. It makes you feel almightly. This game, despite being a fantasy, keeps you down on earth. You know your limits, but you also know how versatile of a character you can be, being bound to multiple character throughout the whole Continent.
Storyline might be a bit confusing at first, but with time you really get a hang of it.
But I do plan on doing that when I get my fill in this game, which is still far far away.
One thing I recommend is to instantly turn on
. Being overleveled occurs rather early in the game, at around level 15 or so, so I recommend that you turn this on as it just makes sure that enemies don't die in a single hit late game so that you get used to it. Not turning it on and wanting to do so late game will most likely result in you reverting the setting back. And trust me, being overleveled is much much more boring than facing a death-threatening enemy with starter gear.",,avaq,,,

So it's a great, immersive world. Absolutely stunning terrain and weather effects and a vast land to poke around. However I wish I was _doing something so, so different_ or more interesting in the actual world. The combat is pretty dull and repetitive besides a few ""set piece"" monster fights I've seen so far. Controls are a bit janky and every room feels cramped while every cave seems way, way too dark. I didn't really get pulled into the (admittedly standard/boring seeming) story, but I'm not much for ""listen to characters talk in third person view while you make 1 of 2 barely different choices"". The open world was so...by the book too. I was hoping they'd change the formula but it was the same tired map icon collecting and repeated events and  concepts. Also merchants with limited gold and being showered with constant, meaningless loot is really tedious (especially when you spend 40% of your time holding Witcher Senses down to see every last minutiae of junk).
I never came home from work thrilled and anxious to play this game, it was a bit of a chore and I had to reason with myself why it would be ""worth it"" to grind through the creeping sense of boredom. The game clearly wasn't a good fit for me but seems to be a smash success for literally hundreds of thousands of people, so who knows.
Overall a sad let down. I was hoping to get utterly hooked and play hours and hours, but alas. Maybe I'll try again and just start with one of the DLCs.",,Deep in Cups,,,

Hundreds of hours worth of content, incredible soundtrack, and a fantastic story. This is one of precious few games in recent memory that has true expansions. Blood and Wine is a must have, it's basically a whole separate game on top of the main story.
This game will throw you right in so if you're not at all familiar with the Witcher, the Netflix show is an excellent introduction to the characters and world. In fact, that's how I got into the game in the first place. I can safely say this is my new favorite game and franchise. I've even started reading the books.

There is probably not much to be said about TW3 that hasn't already been said at this point, but I wanted to add that it's still, and probably will be for a long time, worth playing even if you've no idea about its lore or the previous games.
The story is probably the main selling point for the game, it's very fleshed out and the characters well written. The world also helps bring it to life with myriads of side quests and stories that don't feel repetitive or templated. The gameplay feels fluid and satisfying, especially in higher difficulty levels. The graphics are beautiful, and even when they become dated, you'll still occasionally find yourself just admiring the view from a high place.
Overall I would recommend this game to anyone wanting an enjoyable RPG experience, without grinding or tactic-heavy combat, just to sit back and have fun in a vast and adventure-filled world.",,georgesdoe,,,

,2020-02-08,FALSE,,,,155.7,422,1,292030,223,TRUE,"A great game, with rich story, interesting side quests, and amazing setting.
The world is full of war, plots, and the terrible consequences, with each region shows strikingly different culture, depending on how close they are to the front line.
The graphic is still beautiful in 2019, with wide array of setting available, although i had some trouble with alt tabbing in and out, and frequently glitch the fullscreen.
Gameplay wise its tricky.
The core mechanic, the witcher sense, is quite annoying to use and can be somewhat disorienting and tiring to use. I strongly recomend turning the minimap hud to show the witcher sense just so you wont get stuck while looking for tracks. The whole mechanic is iffy and could be better implemented. Even without the fish eye effect, you need to hold a button to maintain witcher sense, sometimes it slows you to walking pace, the tracks often very hard to see, and it lacks colorblind options. all that complaint combined with how almost all quest and sidequest strongly rely on this gimmick makes this long game somewhat a chore, not to mention the combat.
The combat and skill tree is really shallow. The skill tree looks like it allows player to choose their way to play, but by the end of the day everyone should invest a lot on the blade skills, with every other skill tree optional at best. You can choose to play alchemy, throw bombs, drink potions, oil your blades, and fight for 5 minutes, or just go for blade and swing 4 times to kill a miniboss.
The combat is interesting, but it lacks progression and is very repetitive throughout the game. You gain almost all your signs, oils, potions and bombs early on, with few unlocks as you play, then slowly the oils feels less important, signs is strictly optional, and the same dodge and swing from start to finish.
All in all, the gameplay feels lacking is merely because its accompanied with stellar story, which sets my expectation a bit too high.
The gameplay serves its purpose, as for the rest, I have nothing but praises.",,X1√ê,,,

This game is incredible and I'm really looking forward to playing the DLC which I never got around to. If you haven't played it yet, you're honestly depriving yourself of an experience, not just a game.

Do yourself a favor and play it.
The one criticism I see people bring up that has any merit is that they think it's boring. While, I don't feel that way at all since I'm a huge fan of the world and lore, I can see how people might be put off by the extreme amount of conversations and cut scenes. I find this to enhance the game, but some will find it to be the opposite for them.

In case you're interested in a slightly more info:
Only thing I would advice against is going into the game completely blind. If you are thinking of getting into the game due to the hype, you might end up feeling the game is over hyped. Have a look on Youtube or the wiki and see if the story, lore and characters interest you. The beginning of the game can feel a bit boring so try to mix it up with doing side quests and exploring the map.
Combat also seems to be a deal breaker for some people. It's up to the player to make it interesting. You can choose to just spam right click and dodge here and there until the enemies are eventually defeated or mix up your combat with signs, bombs, bows and so on. The Bestiary helps a lot in harder difficulties.

Overall, game performance is solid, with no hiccups or freezes, and you can enjoyably play it on your mid-range PC. I was getting 40-50 FPS in the base game on High with some options like NVIDIA HairWorks set to Low or Off. ""Blood and Wine"" DLC is more demanding though.
I'd like to address a couple of things. One of them being that you can't set those white navigation points that are shown on the mini-map to your liking. Once you use your green marker, those dots are not changing. They can only point to the quest. Sometimes it's a little confusing and frustrating. Nothing major though.
Also, when you're in the water, it may happen that Geralt won't dive for whatever reason. The only solution I found is to save the game, reload, and then it works again. It doesn't happen often mind you.
There are some other minor inconveniences like Roach getting lost in the way when you call her, or the fact that you can't see the number of owned ingredients while shopping unless you pin specific formula in the Alchemy tab, but it's very rarely interrupting your game.

Was suggested the same by a friend and this was the best choice I ever made. Worth every penny. I haven't even started DLC quests and I'm already 110 hours in , this game is BIG. There are a lot of guarded treasures and secret locations to discover and there is always something to do , something to loot. You may experience some bugs , tho they aren't in any way ruining your experience. The great thing about the game is that you don't really have to play previous games in order to catch up to the story.

The unbeatable, unshameable, can-do-nothing-wrong Witcher 3. You know what it's about in general. You know what many people think about it. But I'm not one of those people. Read on if you want to read a differing opinion. Avoid reading if you're one of the many who pray every night to a shrine of various Witcher 3 paraphernalia.
It's a fine game. I give the story an A++. I give the sound and voice acting an A++. I give the visuals a B+. I give the presentation (UI and UI manipulation) a B. I give the optimization an A+. I give the level of polish a C-. And I give the controls an F. Yes, an F. An F, as in the lowest grade. An F for failure.
I can't express just how much I despise getting around in this game. Geralt moves around like an angry 400-pound guy being propelled by hurricane-force winds. That's how it feels. When you push forward on the analog stick, he starts off at a walk, but very soon after, he breaks into an awkward, janky, closed-fist quick jog, and that awkward movement is to be your primary method of getting around.
Thankfully, the developers made him switch automatically to a walk whenever you enter houses, et al, but the moment you emerge into the outdoors again, you're at the mercy of that janky run. Turning corners while running? Forget it. Geralt only makes ultra wide turns, like a lumbering 18-wheeler turning off the highway without having applied the breaks when they should've been applied. My God, guys.
I know. I know what you're thinking. The game has so much to offer, why not focus on that? Why make your review about this? I'll tell you why: Because the crappy controls prevent me from enjoying all the content to the fullest. Look, I'm not asking for Miyazaki-quality animation here. All I need is a smooth walk-to-run transition that amounts to perhaps three different walking animations of increasing speed BEFORE the run begins. That's nothing to say of the run itself desperately lacking any indication that Geralt is an athlete of any kind. Ugh.
I've gone back and forth, from Xbox One Elite Controller, to Steam Controller, to keyboard and mouse, and I've decided to settle on k/m because the animations are just garbage, so I may as well just jank-run everywhere and keep the walk function bound on my MMO mouse for easy access in case I need to slow his big, dumb self down to turn a corner or stop in front of an NPC to talk to them without body-checking them first.
And the thing is, I know CDPR can do better. They have the talent, don't they? If they didn't then, they should have it now, what with the gobs of money they've made since the game's release.
And why not revisit the game? Why end support of it? Is this not your pride and joy? Bugs are everywhere! I was just in a tavern where some guys were watching an empty stage, hooting and hollering and making lewd noises, only to discover that the ""Strumpet"" they were pretending to watch was doing her little strumpet dance by the tavern door where I came in. Seriously?
Should I even mention the random townsfolk sitting in mid-air in various locations? It's no wonder they're weeping... I'd weep too if I was anchored to the air no matter what I did. And as a cherry on top, every time you die in battle, there's a delay, and then Geralt's corpse does this gravity-defying hop into the air before being thrown across the terrain, as though he were suddenly the victim of a drive-by poltergeist.
Guys, other games have been blasted to pieces in reviews for less bugs than The Witcher 3 has. They've been laughed at, spit at, made the butt of every joke meme you can think of. Mass Effect Andromeda never gave me so many problems. INB4 ""I agreed with you until you supported MEA."" Yeah? Oh well. I'll say it. I'll risk being slammed by gamer mob mentality: Mass Effect Andromeda was and is in a better state than The Witcher 3.
My God, it's just so unpolished. It's so unpolished that I actually fear for the release state of Cyberpunk 2077, so I won't be purchasing that one on release day. I'll wait to watch some gameplay first, and for a patch or two to drop.
Do I recommend the game, ultimately? Yes. Why, after all that? After my annoyances? Because the story is fantastic, and it's long. Anything that well-conceived and long can be weathered in spite of the lack of polish. I can do it. Doesn't mean I'll enjoy the ride to the utmost degree.
P.S. Yes, I only have 4 hours here. But I have over 30 on GOG, which is where you should have bought the game if you wanted to support CDPR to the best of your ability.

You move past a field of wheat and what do you know? It actually moves in the wind, that's a level of detail which is easy to miss but once you spot it it also really adds up.
The story itself is easy to get into, even if you haven't played any earlier titles and are completely new to the franchise.
Finally the controls... there are many to learn and to get familiar with but fortunately the tutorial can help you get up to speed quickly enough. And there's always the in-game glossary which you can use to read up on things such as the tutorial.
So far, so good. It's obvious that a lot of attention has been put to detail and it's noticeable. The atmosphere of the game is  also plain out astonishing.
But....  there are so many nice details to this game that the things which don't go right, or which don't make much sense, easily stand out. And that's a shame.
For example...  In the beginning you come across an inn keeper who's very grateful that you saved their kin and so they tell you: ""
"". Great, but if you then ask them what they got to offer you you'll enter a shopping dialog and suddenly have to pay for bread and other supplies. Whatever happened to my free meal?
You're a Witcher; a warrior who can wield magic and who knows how to stand up against the occult; monsters, demons, etc. To this end you also carry 2 swords: a regular one and one made out of silver, which is more effective against those monsters. However... because of all this Witchers aren't exactly loved by the people, most will distrust you because of all the unnatural things you can do. And you can do a lot... Fighting, magic, brewing potions.
Yet out of everything you can do, you can't manage to repair your own gear. Once your sword starts giving out, which unfortunately seems to happen rather quickly, then you'll need a craftsman to fix it. Really? You can improve on your weapons but you lack the skills to repair them yourselves? Given the dislike and distrust amongst the people regarding the Witchers this made absolutely no sense to me. Surely such an order would try their best not having to rely too much on those who generally mistrust you?
And finally the tutorial explains a lot but not everything... During your first real quest you'll get a crossbow and it's suggested to use it in order to prevent your prey from escaping.  ... if only the game would have also told you how to actually use it, that'd help. But it doesn't. Even the tutorial only mentions your swords and how to exchange between them, yet it ignores the crossbow completely. Eventually I discovered a mention of the crossbow in the spell selection screen, which also made 0 sense to me. But after I selected it I still couldn't fire; the regular button you'd use to cast spells kept casting those. Even though I had selected something completely different....
Eventually I found out, by reading the comment section of a wiki; this mentioned the middle mouse key, but it's still a bit sloppy to say the least.
The atmosphere of this game is awesome and the game itself does a lot of things right. If you're into RPG's which are set in a medieval fantasy environment then prepare to get sucked right into it. The story feels fresh, is easy to follow and plain out intriguing.
There will be a few issues which may not make sense or which may come across as annoying at first, but honestly... those are also easy to ignore. I definitely recommend this game.",,ShelLuser,,,

I've put as much time as I have into this game because it's the only game that truly makes me feel immersed in another world; the characters, the atmosphere, the music -- every second I play this game I'm not just your average first-name, last-name living on the planet Earth.

You can quest in the first zone for hours without ever having solved the main quest.  Of all the witcher games, I have loved this one the most, but that is not to say I didn't not like the first two. The game, however, feeds my OCDs. I have pick the plants on the map so much so that I have to turn off the notifiers so I don't spend the next 3 hours picking blowballs and false parley until crash head first into my keyboard. The quests require a bit of soul searching-- put coins in the purse or let the poor guy keeps his daughter's measley 23 crowns dowrey. There is humour galore, a lot of of dry. There is crafting, skill trees that aren't too obnoxious, and plenty of times when if you don't brew the right potion and put the right oil on your blade it's painfully obvious. I find that pretty good for a game. It makes you stick to the lore and not just overpower things. I forget how to counterattack most days, but at least I get the parries in.  This is my  kind of role playing game, and I'm still playing it almost what, five years after release? (Heck I still play Skyrim, too.)

Even a small side game (Gwent) within the game. The main story is decent too. Optional playing styles because of the use of Signs versus a one dimensional melee style. Graphics are good.  It's only a one player, which is fine since I am not into PvP.  For being a scripted game, it's very good.
Cons: My biggest complaint would be movement.  Specifically, it's a little too overboard with being realistic. I know it's tough to literally stop immediately after running, but Geralt sometimes goes a bit too far and it more of an issue when sliding down half of a mountain when it would be more realistic to grab onto something to stop. A bigger issue is dealing with Roach. One picky horse.  Either it's a glitch or just a clumsy design.  If you aren't on a perfectly smooth path, the horse is a pain to move at times. Reaction... a bit slow.
The only other thing I can think of is... too many deaths from falling from relatively small heights. I don't expect Geralt to be Assassin's Creed because a jump or slip from 30-50 should typically end in death, but 10-15 foot drop and you lose all your health?  It would be more realistic to break a leg then use a ""mend"" potion, which doesn't exist in the game. Meaning, maybe it should. Jump down 10-20 feet... break your leg...

War rages while so does the fukkening. Travel across multiple regions in search of new fhuck. Story is long and detailed but I know Geralt just want fucc. I took 3000 screenshots with nothing to show for it because I'm sure Roach burned my hard drive on purpose to not allow me to release evidence. I think Roach watches Geralt hyuuck. Bad guys get the choppy woppy but not the hard floppy. Can go swimming and get pant wet like Geralt get dikk wet. Collect ingredients to make potions, there might be a viagra potion i dunno.

Kill as many cows as you want I dare you to try it, nothing bad will happen I swear.

The game offers well-crafted stories with choices that you make and which shape your journey. You can become a monster, who incites fear in everything living or not so... Or become Saint Gregory himself, a paragon of virtue who picks daisies, and helps to paint trolls‚Ä?fence.
The World ‚Ä?it‚Äôs massive, as massive as the hole in your heart when you finish the game. Hundreds of locations, more NPCs to talk to than real life, each with their stories and quests to offer‚Ä¶and some even more than that, if you catch my meaning.
Gorgeous graphics and animations, superb voice acting. Your jaw will drop, more times than wind has howled. Each time you ride through city or see a mountain range immersion takes a hold of you, and after some time you‚Äôll never want to go outside again. Even the most mundane thing you do, will feel as if orchestra is following your every step, with three ladies yodeling about your every move.
Fighting will become a second nature to you, using swords, potions and signs to your advantage, reading books about monsters. Learning how to slay beasts for money and not getting your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô?killed in process is an experience only few games offer.
Witcher 3 aged like a fine wine. Considering games that have come out in past couple of years, this game will take a hold of you. You will be satiated - real life will seem bleak and boring. While being at school or work, only thing you will be thinking about is ‚Ä?how can I complete that contract and what armor should I wear for my next fight.
This game deserves every praise and your money in full.",7.65612E+16,Gregorss,,,

This is such a good experience. Geralt is a great character, all wise and tough like an old jedi. His world is beautiful and the buffet of monsters to hunt is large. The writing is absolutely incredible, the story somewhat less so, but very worth it.
The gameplay loop gets repetitive. But this is really one of the few games where that didn't bother me much. Too much good stuff here to be a gamer purist. Recommended.

The open world is amazingly, lovingly...almost mind-bogglingly detailed.  Every corner of every map has -something-.  The empty marsh with a forgotten secret treasure.  The unexpectedly beautiful vista after climbing a rise, standing out in such a stark contrast to the warn-torn countryside you've traveled through to get there.  Abandoned cabins which tell a story all of their own.  This is all the EXTRAS.  Places you do not have to visit. It's all just ...there, waiting to be discovered.
The quest design is brilliant.  Given the complexity of trying to make a story in an open world where you could find things completely in the wrong order, the designers are nearly flawless in the execution.
Most of all, controlling Geralt feels ...natural.  Much, much better than Witcher 2.  I am NOT a power gamer and yet I can easily crossbow an oncoming foe, cast a quick sign for protection and draw my blade to attack.  This is also the first game where riding a horse and piloting a small skiff works so well I don't mind doing it, even when sometimes I could quick travel.  There are some places that are just fun to gallop your horse through.  Or speed your boat through the waters.
The scope of this game is just breathtaking.   The story is dark and gritty, so much so that you wonder if the world isn't so completely messed up that you should just let the bad guys win.  But then there are those moments - and they are rare, true, but moments where you have a chance, if you want, to make a bit of hope.  Restore a village.  Save a merchant.  Bring a family back together.   You can't change the world - Kings will be ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô?and wars will be wars - but you can do your part to make it better, one quest at a time.  This is the part that seems -most- analogous to our everyday real lives:  we can't stop politicians from being ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô?or wars and violence from happening, but we can do our part to make the world a little better place, one day at a time.",,Kaji,,,

(only reason it's not top 3 is because multiplayer games are more my cup of tea)
The story and world is fleshed out, raw, mature, kinky and gruesome with little to no room for improvement, it's good enough that you end up reading all the flavor text, but you're not forced to closely read up on any of it to understand what's going on, you could probably just open most readable's once and the game will note down any important points you need later, bringing it up when you need it.
Combat is hard and unforgiving if you don't stock up on healing items, but a few skills can make healing items way to effective, I mean ""food items last 20 min"" who thought that sounded balanced.
Was hoping taking on certain types of monsters would require more preparation but at the same time I'm glad you're not totally boned if you're in combat with a ghost and didn't bring it's weakness with you.
Music is spot on luxury to the ears, though I did get enough of the combat theme after a while.
Leveling and gear is well thought out and can accommodate a wide range of playstyles, light armor for high  amounts of time spent combat rolling, heavy armor if you can't be asked to dodge even to save your life and medium for people with decent dodging skills but still want to live if they mess up a dodge.

People are SO RUDE and I'm loving it, I think some of the NPC's would just fall apart if they don't call someone or something the son of a woman of easy virtues every other sentence.

The small fraction of the reviews are negative and most of them relates to this issue. If your main source of entertainment comes from combat then it might be hard to ""get into"" in your first hours. After a few hours the story grips you, and at that point, the game transforms into a high quality TV Show with constant cliffhangers which keeps you ""hooked up"" until the end.

It really pushes the engine to its limit, in terms of the diversity of what all the character models and environmental assets are being asked to do. As compared to how things must have looked for the first couple weeks of this game, the tiny glitches that are still left are mostly graphical in nature - certainly not game-breaking, which is more than can be said of pretty much any other AAA game released since. Any 'grind' is pretty much unnoticeable, since there's something interesting for your character to do, no matter your level. Mod support is excellent, and the mod community is still active. The controls? Eh, at first, I hated the way 'spells' were cast and 'items' were used. However, now, I see that the game developer's goal was to force players to strategically predict encounters with enemies, and plan things out, rather than relying on pure reflexes and spamming buttons to win. The expansions are also badass. Great deal, overall - I spent $15 bucks on the whole collection on a steam sale, which I consider to be my best game purchase, yet.

One thing I have issues though is movement for both Geralt and the horse (especially the horse). I was expecting a Red Dead Redemption kind of horse but what I got was a cockroach. The horse just can't keep on the road. It prefers bumping into a tree or heading into a cliff which of course it subsequently tries to avoid falling from. This happens a lot when I gallop. I hate it when it misses bridges too and tries to probably throw me into rivers. That being said, the games is great overall. Get it now.",7.65612E+16,Neo Pureya,,,

It's immersive, it set a new standard to open world character-driven narrative games, and most importantly, it's a nice big ""‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you"" to EA because, just as everyone with a brain knows, single player games are NOT dead. This game is a golden answer to that.
It is not without flaws, of course, but the flaws I found and experienced as I played through this game for nearly 400 hours is equivalent to sand between my toes while I enjoy my time at the beach ‚Ä?it's annoying to have them but it doesn't put a damper to everything else I experienced. This game is time and money well spent, truly revolutionary in a lot of aspects.
Some might say that God of War may be that game and I wouldn't blame them for it. It's just that, to me, the time I spent going in blind (I've yet to read the books and I went into this game without having played the previous ones) is definitely one of if not the most memorable moments of my life as someone who is a simple fan of video games.

Graced a ride along
With Geralt of Rivia
Along came this song
When the White Wolf fought
A silver tongued devil
His army of elves
At his hooves did they revel
They came after me
With masterful deceit
Broke down my lute
And they kicked in my teeth
While the devil's horns
Minced our tender meat
And so cried the Witcher
He can't be bleat
Toss a coin to your Witcher
Oh, valley of plenty
Oh, valley of plenty, oh
Toss a coin to your Witcher
Oh, valley of plenty
At the edge of the world
Fight the mighty horde
That bashes and breaks you
And bring you the morn, oh
He thrust every elf
Far back on the shelf
High up on the mountain
From whence it came
He wiped out your pest
Got kicked in his chest
He's a friend of humanity
So give him the rest
That's my epic tale
Our champion prevailed
Defeated the villain
Now pour him some ale

The graphics are fantastic, the voice acting is fantastic, the story is fantastic, and aimed at a mature audience. There is SO much content to discover and the DLC's add dozens of hours more.

The thing about the Witcher 3 which sets is apart from the rest is a level of craftsmanship in the world from the main quests, side quest, general world building and random encounters. For example, I was attach by some random bandits on horseback near Velen and I killed them with ease. Went ahead and looted their camp only to find a letter from one of the bandits to their wife which mentioned bringing something home for the young'un from their ""da"". It got me thinking and whilst a small addition to the game, it makes you think about how these bandits are people beyond simple video-game fodder.
Other endearing parts of the game are the easter eggs and callbacks to previous games (for those who played Witcher 1/2 like myself).

The sheer number of side quests the base game itself offers is insane, and of actually good quality, length, and story development, unlike most fetch quests games of this genre may usually suffer from. The main story itself is good too, though you'll likely find yourself ignoring the questline as exclamation points or question marks constantly pop up as you even make your way to the next destination. Before you know it, you've spent 2 hours on finishing side quests and contracts, and playing gwent alone.
Another thing that makes the story stand out is the fact that choices actually feel like they have impact in this game. Missing or ignoring certain side quests, or choosing bad options during the game can drastically affect the outcome of the game in terms of its lore (if you care about that). Also, you may miss out on certain gwent cards which is a massive rip. As such, you live with your decisions, something games for some reason find difficult to make work.
The overall environment looks beautiful and cutscenes, especially *certain* ones, are very well animated, making the game feel more immersive as a whole. The OST, characters, and ""herbs schmerbs, but how 'bout some gwent"" are great.

The equipment is pointless. Your swords will be 10 levels past their prime for hours of gameplay. Run three witch bounties and you'll replace your original and two of the bounty sword rewards in 30 minutes.
The story doesn't care about how you play. There is no time or performance penalty. Racing an NPC? You're fine to stand around for 30 minutes then run through normally and win.

,2020-02-02,FALSE,,,,117.9,526,0,292030,25,TRUE,"This game is definitely one of the best games I have ever played. The amount of care, detail, and attention put into everything is absurd. Every sidequest, even the most mundane ones, have charm and meaning to them. Every structure you find has a story behind it. All the enemies have unique and interesting designs and mechanics. The world is absolutely beautiful and is a wonderfully realistic and immersive setting. Novigrad is easily my favorite video game city of all time.
But I do not understand the unending praise this game gets.
Don't get me wrong. This game is absolutely fantastic. But this game is not a masterpiece. You hear this term just about everywhere, but it's a flawed gem. No game is perfect. Every game has problems. And the Witcher 3 has some annoying, hard to ignore problems.
The combat, for a game of this scale, is pretty great. It's clunky at first but you get a hang of it after a while. It's complete ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô?when fighting multiple enemies though. Those Wild Hunt Hounds are absolute hell to fight in packs. Hitboxes can be occasionally janky and enemy telegraphs aren't clear a lot of the time. The biggest problem with the combat, however, is that after a certain point it becomes way too easy. I was playing on the second highest difficulty and I was spam clicking just about every enemy without much trouble. The only things that challenged me were the three big bosses you face towards the end of the game. I really liked the feeling in the opening of the game where you had to prepare before a big fight. Brew a bunch of potions, buy food, temper your weapons, etc... and you do that for like 4 more levels and you don't have to anymore. Really wish that feeling was consistent throughout the game.
I find that the story loses some of its stride after the climax. It becomes a generic save the world plot - more about stopping the big bad than about developing characters or finding new interesting ones. There's really only three characters other than Geralt that see development during the final act. It's a real step down from when you were travelling across the Northern Realms, finding old and new friends, discovering their motivations, and watching them have actual character development. Just kinda stagnated towards the end. Also the ending is meh. Really could've used more explanation and there was some stuff that just... made no sense. The ending wasn't offensive, it was just 'whelming'.
I. Hate. The. Minimap. It's bad. Since nearly every single quest has a location objective where you have to travel somewhere through complex road systems (getting Roach through a forest or swamp is a pain in the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô?so taking the roads are just easier), you have to heavily rely on the minimap's little dotted line telling you where to go. This is bad. You end up looking at the minimap 50% of the time. It's more difficult to immerse yourself in this beautiful world when you're not looking at it half the time. I turned off the minimap which greatly improved my experience, but I still had to open the map a lot to know where I'm going. It was pretty satisfying when in Novigrad I memorized the streets so I only had to glance at the map once or twice though.
I won't be going in depth about the pros of the game because I'm sure every review here will do that for you. I do still highly recommend this game. I'd say its a must-play.
One warning though: If you're looking to play a game that's about exploration first, story second, this ain't it. You'll still enjoy it but it won't be what you expect. The world is meant to be more of a realistic and immersive setting to the main story and the multitudes of sidequests there are. It's a different take on the world that I don't really mind. Breath of the Wild is still my favorite open world adventure game to date though.
P.S. kinda salty that this game stole all the rewards from Bloodborne in 2015 ngl",,Keeko,,,

,2020-02-01,FALSE,,,,108,531,0,292030,72,TRUE,"At the time of this review, just a few months separate us from the fifth anniversary of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. The game has been called out by many to be the game of the decade, and I've decided to do a short no-spoilers retrospection on why is that the case. All of this coming from a player that hasn't even started his first NG+. PS.: I intended to keep this review short, but as I couldn't, I will include a TL;DR section below, targeted specifically to people that have not yet decided on whether to buy the game or not.
As you play as Geralt of Rivia, an already fleshed out character with its own personality and acquaintances right from the start, I would not dare call this game an RPG, but it is far simpler than saying that it is a ""story driven action game with lots of decisions to make, some of which may have bigger or lesser impacts on the main story. Oh and you have lots of character progression, with various skill trees you can choose abilities from as well as lots of bombs, oils, potions, weapons and armor you can craft with materials you gather along your journey"".
This RPG aspects of the game might drive out players that don't enjoy the genre, but it is very likely that they fall in love with any other aspect of the game. Aside from that, the game has four difficulties in total, and only the highest one REALLY demand you to make full use of these aspects to have an advantage; the other two allow you to have the upper hand whether you utilize the games' mechanics at full or not.
The combat is pretty basic, but it is very exciting and has a fluidity that makes up fully for its lack of depth. Combine that with any battle music track that the game rocks, and you will have an epic fight even against a simple drowner.
The music, as already foreseen, is simply amazing. I genuinely did not have any moment where I thought ""hey this track is somewhat lackluster"". Hell, there was this one time that I ended up humming 'Merchants of Novigrad' all day (for those who do not know, Novigrad is an important city of the game, and what I mentioned is an ambient music track played on said city). As I do not have any intricate thoughts on the matter, I beckon it will suffice to say that The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt stars one of the best soundtracks that I have ever listened to on a video game. Who woulda thunk.
Even though you play the role of an already built character with relationships of his own, the games' story and general narrative are incredibly enjoyable, not to mention that you still have a whole lot of decisions that build on Geralts' personality and make him a different character overall. Geralt is a really good main character, and he is one of the main reasons I keep playing the game. He's cool and interesting, his insights on various situations and his conversations with almost every character made me really want to flesh out his character and get to know his personality and relationships. The game has a large amount of secondary quests and contracts, and almost every change of track on your adventures rewards you something.
And we yet have to disclose graphics. The game was for me an INFINITELY immersing experience from the beginning. While you travel through the world you will encounter a lot, believe me, A LOT of incredibly beautiful places, landscapes and towns. I really recommend playing on High graphic settings, even at the expense of some frames if you don't have a high-end PC. Halfway through the game I just ramped up my settings just for the sake of even more beautiful landscapes, and at least for me, 50+ FPS is already an amazingly cinematic experience. Just the view from the balcony at Kaer Morhen on the very first scene of the game told me this was going to be a beautiful experience.
And it was just that. From joy to grief, from sadness to excitement, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt made me feel a lot of different things. I really recommend that you play the game without spoiling yourself anything. The emotional spikes hit harder that way, and it really helps that you involve yourself on the narrative and on the characters' problems.
The only things I found to be issues to me were horse traveling, minor problems with the 'enemy upscaling' feature (on a certain djinn fight specifically), the underdeveloped character that was our main antagonist, and that the urgency of the main quest is not reflected on Geralts' journey (this, from my point of view, was inevitable, given the type of game the developers wanted to build, and the main quests' theme on the other side of the table). Two of those issues I cannot refer to due to my 'no-spoiler' disclosure, but they don't affect how the game feels AT ALL. And don't misinterpret me, the horse traveling isn't bad at all, in fact it is really good and it achieves its purpose. The only thing that bothered me were those moments where the horse randomly stopped while galloping, which lead me to just canter, and keep enjoying the scenery. A good thing overall, I guess.
TL;DR: TW3 is a must-try game. It goes really cheap for what it is on sales, and if it doesn't really hurt your pocket, then you must ABSOLUTELY try it. If it doesn't catch you when finishing the first act, then you can reconsider. If it is the RPG aspects that scare you, then believe me that they are not a big deal, specially on easier difficulties. They might even draw you into them as you play the game. TW3 rocks an amazingly good soundtrack, beautiful landscapes, and fluid combat. In this review I couldn't stress enough everything that I felt while playing the game, nor I was able to comment on every well done aspect the game has.
And that 'sums up' my experience. Please forgive my abuse of the same adjectives on multiple parts of the review, and my redacting skills. I didn't really intend to make it this long. If you have any recommendations, things to add or points to discuss, please feel free to leave a comment!",,Ragrez,,,

The depth of every story is incredible, even in the scraps of paper you find on the side of a road. The quests are satisfying without exception, even when they're glorified fetch missions, simply because the dialogue is so engaging.
Combat is quite simple, but never feels boring. Getting new potions, oils and decoctions feels rewarding. The skill trees have their flaws (some early game perks are broken, some late game perks are terrible), but overall make it feel worthwhile to try different builds for the fun of it (even on the hardest difficulty, nothing is brutally challenging without mods).

But combat itself, along with all the various animations, is simply fluid and beautiful, especially on harder difficulties it is challenging all the way through the game. And the graphics is stunning for now several-years-old game.

,2020-02-01,FALSE,,,,163,539,7,292030,188,TRUE,"People call this the best RPG/Open world game ever created, I think that's overrating this game. Personally I prefer the first 2 games in the series since they followed a non-linear ""act"" based format instead of Open World.
It's already been said a million times but the graphics, writing, sound, music are great. So I won't go deep into that.
The locations and visuals are a downgrade from Witcher 2. I mean go back to Flotsam Forest in W2 and then back into W3's ""Trees and a random copy paste village in between open world""
It does suffer a bit from Ubisoft syndrome where there's a lot of copy and paste activities sprinkled around the map but they can be easily ignored if you want and it's best to focus on side quests and Witcher contracts. The weakest quest types are usually treasure/scavenger hunts.
Crafting/Alchemy is still under developed and bloated. On the bright side, the game is incredibly long to support them this time, since Witcher 2 was 20-30 hours long. The movement, animations, horse controls etc are really average compared to most third person games.  The Combat is a slightly improved Witcher 2, never has and never will be great.
Trust me for someone who has played the first and the second games for over a decade, the series has always been carried by it's storyline, characters and writing. The Witcher has always been a gloried walking simulator and I'm okay with that. Yennifer, Bloody Baron, The Crones and Ciri are the highlights here.
The games first part which takes place in Velen is some of the best stuff I've seen in the series. However, once you reach Novigrad you'll experience what I found to be the weakest part of the game. The problem is the whole Dandelion part being dragged on probably even breaking the record for way too many fetch quests. Considering the game has another island to explore after that, you could get burned out especially if you're unfamiliar with the first 2 games. Also the whole ""roleplaying"" and choice making doesn't seem to effect you drastically in this game beyond choosing how big of a prick you want Geralt to be.
The weakest part of the entire game though is Eredin and everything to do with the Wild Hunt. Three freaking games for it to play out this way? Why did he have to take off his mask? Yes Letho and Geralt talk about the Wild Hunt being Aen Elle but I would have preferred if they still maintained some kind of mystic around him. I remember being excited back in 2007 and not being familiar with the books thinking that the Wild Hunt was going to be a rendition of the myth of the dead army that roams across the sky.
Game is incredibly long, being an open world game, the 80% of your playtime will be you getting from point A to Point B. I enjoyed it but actually did see myself getting burned out by the time I finished the main story, Heart Of Stone and it's sidequests to move on to Blood and Wine which takes place in Toussaint.
My recommendation is to play Blood and Wine after taking a break from finishing Main game and HOS. Heart Of Stone is the second highlight of the game, first being the Baron/Crones questline. Another highlight is Gwent being far better than dice as a minigame this time around.
Verdict: While I think the third game is probably the weakest, and the series never managed to get combat/crafting right it's a great end to one of my favourite game trilogies.",,Unconquered,,,

Also like many others, I picked it up again after The Witcher Netflix series sparked my interest again. This time I downloaded a few QoL and texture mods before going along my marry way. The story can be good at times, but also cliched and boring many other times. It's hard to put into words but there isn't any immediate thrill in terms of exploring the world, and the monotonous quests don't help with that.
If you're not collecting bounties then you're using your witcher senses to be Sherlock Holmes, and that gets rather repetitive after some time. The combat also felt really boring and unimaginative. You have all sorts of weapons at your disposal such as bombs, crossbows, swords, and magic, and each enemy has weaknesses for you to take advantage of but I rarely found myself using these tools. Maybe on harder difficulties there's more emphasis on using oils and other things, but I don't know how much more difficult you can make the game when all you really need to do is learn when to parry/dodge/roll.
I enjoyed the story in the beginning, but by the time I got to Skellige I was skipping through dialogue to just try and wrap the game up before my boredom made me drop it again. The ending was lackluster and predictable, and there's a NG+ option but I'm not sure if I have the drive to go through it all again. For now I'll be trying the DLC's.",,N8MOTO,,,

The graphics and optimization for me are astounding, 60 FPS on almost everything ultra with a decent PC. Loading times are extremely quick for me which allows for minimal downtime when starting or fast travelling. The multiple free DLC's add some nice things to be enjoyed (alternate looks, different finishers, ect). Lastly Gwent, this card game that you can play with NPC's offers the ability to be able to take a break from the main game and just play cards.

The DLC's: When I had finished Heart of Stone, I thought
was a great DLC with a lot of content and story, and was the better of the two. Boy was I in for a treat with Blood and Wine then. That blew me away. From a doom and gloom type of setting and swampy or snowy biomes you go into a world of eternal summer and sunshine. Sometimes I wish the whole game had the atmoshphere of Toussaint.
recommend getting the DLC's. Both of them. (though if you really must choose, I'd get Blood and Wine).

It is not possible to say everyone will like this game. Sometimes movement can be funky particularly boats and to a lesser extent Roach, but if you want a good story you must play this.
Combat is incredibly level based. Enemies a few levels above you will kill you in a single hit without signs, enemies your level or just above are somewhat challenging, and enemies below you are just flies.

It's everything so rich in details, the developers clearly though every inch of the world and mande it full of life. That creates a worthy and remarkable experience. Plus the system of choice makes you carry a sense of consequence at every corner. There were choices I regreted the whole game, and that's the cool of it.
I played at hard difficulty (Blood and Broken Bones!) and can say that the gameplay is set so the game won't forgive many mistakes. Even enemy 10 lvls below yours can make significant damage. Also, populating the world with sidequests and locals with creatures of different lvls makes up for desperate escapes when you face iminent death. And that's a brilliant scale up, as you'll always have stuff to do.  I chose to do every side mission of the game. Finished base game in 110 hours. Another 40 hours for DLCs.
There's so much that add to the gameplay, to the overall experience, that is quite remarkable how they balanced the game. Looting, crafting, alchemy, signs, oils, potions, bombs, guns, merchants and money, they even created their own card game FFS (Gwent). Also, creating a vast variety of creatures and enriching the lore with the bestiary and a journal entry for each character. That's a hell of a work, props to CD Project Red. Granted, I only played this game 4 years after release, they could make some tweaking but I got to experience a masterpiece.
When I entered DLC territory I decided to add some mods to enhance the experience and god was that a right move. I did not altered gameplay in any means, only added quality to visuals and quality of life improvements. But going through the mods list I was delighted of how much of a new experience can one get from the game by adding mods. There are even those that completely rehauls the entire gameplay, rebalancing everything, and makes up for a better and more daring/challenging walkthrough. And all that with a great concern of maintaining the lore. Mod community clearly expands a game's life. I can definetely see myself coming back for a replay with a different approach.
I was not able to drag myself through the first two games (shame) as it is too dated and clunky for my taste but before entering the 3rd I watched videos carefuly explaining the story and boy was I hyped to start. Don't know if the books could provide as much enjoyment as this game (I'll definetely read at a later time), which has cemented itself as a GOAT for a lot of people.

Pros:
Great graphics
Great writing.  On the side quests in particular. Does not feel like busy work.  Interesting stuff
Music is atmospheric though repetitive
Immersive open world
Neutral
Combat.  Better than skyrim but not as engaging as it  could be although I beat it only on normal so maybe it is more interesting on higher difficulties. Feels a bit spammy with the potion gimmick
Cons
Story ending was disappointing.  Lots of dangling threads and the ending was shorter than some sidequest cutscenes.

I am a witcher fanatic i also played and completed previous games, I think the plot will be more concrete in your head if you also play (or at least know) the plot of 1st and 2nd game. However, for my general view, i am already caught up for the plot so I would say the plot is tastefully complex, the  main characters have depth and personalities, and your choices in the game are actually matter (pretty much unlike the telltale games lol) . The additions of various contracts/ suprize exclamation mark quests / treasure hunts the context quality of gameplay is pretty advance and extended, I would say. I am actually up to 123 H of gameplay (I was offline most of the time) and i still didnt finish it, sometimes i just open the game and walk around the game doing nothing. (I'll give my reasoning below)
Other than these, I never encountered with any bugs, no opening problems, the game's dynamics is pretty much  flowing and waiting time is fast for me.
In short, I really enjoyed the game and maybe this one is #1 game of my list. My absolute favorite. I definitely recommend everyone at least try their chance with this series.  (not just because I am in love with geralt. but for the reasons here lol)
(spoilers ahead)
I'll start with what I really like, which is the small details, for example(one of my favorite moments), i did choose the comedy option for the theater that was so good, quite later on in the game, while i was casually walking on the streets of novidgrad, a random elderly women said that she liƒ±ked my performance there and laughed outloud.  This moment gave me the feeling of realism, and made me forget i am in a game and those were NPC's. I started to look at them as real persons inside the game instead of npc's, especially if you are a slow-player and you like to stop and listen what people say. The immersive environment made me feel like i really lived in that middle age surreal world maybe because I also played the game with ultra settƒ±ngs 60 fps rtx. This game becomes superb when you install HD mod ,  i literally stopped per every 30 seconds to look at the environment and beautiful designs of every object.
The critiques: I would expect more skins/different clothes etc. I really like fashion in a game alot and i spend money for outfits not armors or swords lol
even though there are many monsters, I would expect more varƒ±ous monster types (because it becomes repetitive after a while) . Fiends looking the same, bears are same, vampires are same, trolls are the same. What i want different types more interesting ones, for example make gargoyles more like gargoyles not like trolls.  OR More collossal ones. For example i really liked the Kayran quest in witcher 2. There was no such foe until now in W3.
Also i really would appreciate more blood, more gore and more realistic blood.
Also
please bring an dlc to fix Yennefer / triss triangle please because i really love two of them at the same time. I cannot choose one over another, no matter how much i try. Polyamory exists sooo maybe you can do something about this.
Thank you,
Best regards

Well, all that, and the witty conversations, the heart-wrenching moments when I had to make choices that I know could never be easy, that no choice could be a lesser evil, the characters that lived with you, stayed with you and died with you along the way with every choice you made, and you know for sure that they will live within your memories forever... the monsters, the ghosts that you almost feel sorry for them... for their stories are so sad, so bitter and make you wonder do they really deserve the end of my silver sword...

,2020-01-29,FALSE,,,,22.4,597,0,292030,263,TRUE,"This is a very extensive RPG with phenomenal mature story telling. Plenty to explore, a plethora of side quests and a decently long main story, dialogue, time wasting, card games, (Gwent.)
You'll see a lot of visual and dialogue relating to war, the hardships of war, the victims, the butchered, the great and unjust crimes.
You will heavily explore Geralt being treated as an inferior being because he is a Witcher and not a Human.
I definitely agree with the games popularity and understand why so will add another voice to its success and recommendation.
Adding on to the main game is the expansions and excellent list of free content including some extra contracts.
Combat is extensive in regards to abimltiies, armor, weapons, potions, bombs, magic signs, horse combat.
People say the game has clunky controls, I agree to a small extent, still extremely modern and playable. Roach, (your horse,) is fairly doping, has some really odd pathing amd it is preferable to fast travel because Roach can't stick to the correct path, (or any,) quite often and he is not fond of bridges crashing to a halt.
I think the earliest and also best example of the mature story telling is the story of the Bloody Baron and his family. It covers a myriad of social issues from alcoholism, to family violence, to death, children, a fathers love, a fathers agony of mistakes, loss, love.
Gwent - to begin with the game comes with its own in game card game, Gwent. It is a very simple and surprisingly fun thing to play and will leave you ignoring the story for many hours.
Horse racing - There are quite a few horse races to compete in, put money in, gain renown and vs better riders etc.
Boxing - there are boxing tournaments with varying degrees of difficulty
The map exploration is just filled with towns, cities, caves, interesting sights, endless horse riding, yacht driving, item gathering, dialogue, sights, enemies, wild animals, magical creatures, side quests, small hilarious, sad or crazy happenings. There are many [?] locations to be revealed when you explore them. You can track bounties, find treasure, formulate alchemy, find treasure hunts, letters, Witcher gear, lore and back story and a very many chances to make many minor, petty and main quest or side quest changing decisions, such as throw fights to help a poor farmer, kill mercilessly, hand people in, hand out justice, be greedy, get paid off. You get the chance to disrespect a king born to be revered, have romantic relationships with various women, (I'm early on and so far it is flirting with Truss alongside your ""relationship"" with Yennefer.) There are some heart breaking endings to some characters lives too that will wrench at your soul, disappoint you, you'll be in control or the main antagonist behind some deaths, you will fight the Wild Hunt, (another version of the walking dead from Game of Thrones, regarding the White Walker leaders.)
There's definitely a lot more to touch on, but this game, it is just phenomenal mature RPG story telling that really works.
You're really missing out by not atleast trying this game out. I'd say a good serving of this game is atleast until you get out of Velen, into Novigrad.
White Orchard servers as a very small starting area for players too, it shows many different aspects of play, introduces Gwent, the main story, contracts, side quests, treasure, Witcher gear, alchemy, using alchemy against different monsters/beasts/magik.
There are so many thousands of positive reviews for this game, if you've read this far and like the sound of it, definitely pick this long, content filled mature RPG up! It is a complete 10/10 thumbs up for me and the horse stuck on my roof says get it too.

I should warn you, it is very standard for Open World RPG Games. There is a main quest, which involves going from place to place, meeting NPCs, and solving their fetch or kill quests. With as much of it as I have played, it is really average storytelling. Nothing really groundbreaking.
However, it also has a metric ton of side-quests. These really flesh out the world and give you a good sense of the story, and the world in which the story inhabits. This is, at least at only 9 hours into the game, the real reason to play this game.
Gamplay? Oh? That? You swing a big sword. Throw some spells. There is a fair amount of alchemy. Your horse is fun to ride. Kill-loot-sell-buy-upgrade-kill-loot-sell-upgrade-you-know-the-drill. But it is at least as of this time, an enjoyable loop.
Graphics are top notch. Definitely a lot of work went into that. Especially the environmental effects. Some of the storms you can almost feel.
Sound Effects? Do you remember when Blizzard was King of the sound effects with Diablo II? Well, this is better than they ever were. These sounds are part of what makes the environment so believable.
Music? No clue. I always turn that off.
My premature thoughts? This is a good game worth playing, if you are into Open World Fantasy RPGs.

The combat feels a tiny bit stiff if you using the lock on mode for targets as there no way to alternate between targets so if you are fighting say 5 bandits and Target one of them there a really high chance youll get hit from the back ( if anyones actually found a way to alternate between targets please let me know cause I haven't found anything)
The mods for this game very from redesigning armor sets like the Griffin set (cause it REALLY needs it) too weather, climate and millions of others to choose from.

You really have to pay attention to the dialogue or miss hints on the best decisions to make.  Very little is black and white in this game.

As a fan of the first two games and RPGs in general I absolutely love this game and highly suggest it to anyone who enjoys a good RPG. My biggest suggestion actually comes from a friend who played it and that's to focus on the main story, and do side quests that appear along your way. I wasn't expecting the game to be near as long so I focused solely on side quests for a while and ended up reaching and spoiling areas that the story would later take me to. Here's a list of the good and bad I found with it:
Gwent!! The mini card game is a nice change of pace from the dice poker and easily one of the funnest things about the game.
The shear size of the world and the various ways to get around. The world is huge, Skyrim if not bigger size, and it has ways for you to travel quickly but spaces them out so you can experience some of the little moments you would miss if you did nothing but jump from spot to spot.
Inventory in this one was handled very well, along with equipment/crafting being the best out of the three games in my opinion.
The story was well balanced, and paced in my opinion. Better than the first game in that it didn't feel rushed anywhere but not quite as good as the second....I think primarily it felt dragged out in spots.
The characters, not just the main ones but all of the npcs and the random dialogue you got to listen in on as you walked about.
The length of the game. Don't get me wrong its worth your money, my 200 hours was my first play through without the expansions, so there's no lack of good content. It just feels like at times that they could have broken it up into smaller games, where it would have been easier to keep track of all that was going on rather than having such a long and multiple thread story.
The Character tree feels disconnected from the game. It's not hard to understand by any means but I honestly didn't feel any difference in ability as I leveled up. It's not like the first two games where I could tell a difference each time I gained a level and added new abilities. Personally I saw more change through equipment than anything else.
The loading recap of the story. Its nice when you girst boot up the game but then if you choose to load your game it replays it again. There were times I would go through several loads to try different things and it got very tiring hearing it every time I loaded.
The text font/color during cut scenes. It's great for not distracting from the scene but when you had the timed reactions it felt like I never had enough time to fully read my options. I've never been a big fan of timed respones but at least make the choices easier to read.",7.65612E+16,midgkahn,,,

Game play - A decent amount of variable game play considering you can only play as a character with a two handed sword. Combat feels rewarding and makes you feel like you are the well trained Witcher you are playing as. However, depending on your control device it can also be frustrating. The 3rd person view didn't track well with my controller sometimes leading me to blind movements that were not always conducive to Geralt's continued health and wellness.

Normally, I'd stick to competitive multiplayer games or at least difficult games like dark souls. I'm someone who strives to master some sort of ability when playing games. However, the Witcher 3 makes an exception. Of course, there are plenty of things to be learned, but it doesn't have the depth when it comes to the actual combat-system, which feels rather monotone. This of course is just my opinion and I'm sure there are many arguments to be made against it, especially since there are far worse games out there.
I love this game for the stories, quests and the writing of almost all characters which sets a new standard when it comes to videogames. It's basically the only one, in which I don't skip the dialog, even on my second playthrough. It's just that well written and I love the voiceacting.
Without going into further details, the game is great and considering the value for money - especially on sales -, there is almost no reason not to own it. This doesn't mean it's without flaw. For example, as I already mentioned, the combat-system, which made me stop my first playthrough for more then a year because I got bored of it (I started watching let's plays instead, and yes, it's actually a perfect match). On my second playthrough I modded the combat with ghost mode, which makes it far more interesting, at least for me personally and the difficulty can further be adjusted.

I am now in my second playthrough (new game+) and have sunken 196 hours into it, and I'm still not fed up with it.
This game ages gracefully - Although there are still a few pretty mind boggling bugs remaining in the game in some quest lines. Some game mechanics will feel off or ""old"" at times (like Geralts less than precise movement outside combat), but the game itself, it's story and EVEN Gwent (Just give it a shot. It's not that complicated) is very entertaining.
The expansions are really well made - And Blood and Wine (the second and final big DLC), if it was published or made by lesser men - Would have been a separate game; cause it has a completely different feel to it, lasts longer than expected and brings a whole bunch of new stuff to the game and at the same time adds more polished animations, cut scenes and dialogue.

,2020-01-27,FALSE,1,,,38.4,644,4,292030,143,FALSE,"It's a good game but wildly overrated. I've put a few dozen hours into it, haven't enjoyed it at all. I'll probably finish it for the sake of completing the story.
There are 2 things that ruin this game for me. First, the writing. Second, the level zones. The game is heavily story-focused, but all of the quests and locations have level zones like in an MMO. That means (despite all the talk about ""choices matter"") there's really only one way to play through the narrative. And if you don't go that route, then you'll be facing Drowners that are 10 levels above you and take 20 minutes to kill. You CAN kill them (that's how easy the game is)... it's just going to take forever and be really boring.
My other complaint is the writing. I don't know why everyone says this is such a well-written game. It's not. The writing isn't bad in a technical way, it's bad in a creative way. The Witcher's world is too bleak and hopeless to be believable. Almost everyone is a terrible person, and everyone seems okay with that. One king commits incest, another fantasizes about torture. There's a prostitute on every street corner, and the only representation of religion in the game is a fanatical cult of witch-burning monotheists. *Rolls eyes at thinly veiled Catholic Inquisition reference*.
The result of this design choice is that the characters just don't talk like real people. The game keeps shoving selfish pessimists and suffering wretches into your face, demanding that you accept the total lack of goodness as realistic. Characters keep telling you how bad things are. They try to show you how ""dark & gritty"" they are by swearing a lot and making ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• jokes. Even the kings & nobleman act like this, and it's really unnatural. I mean, when was the last time the Queen of England made a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• joke then bragged about torturing her enemies? People just don't TALK this way. Not everyone, at least. And not all of the time.
At 20 hours in, I was wondering ""doesn't anyone ever smile in this world?"" Turns out, somebody did. Then that somebody mutilated a prostitute's corpse, hung it from his ceiling, and begged me not to gut him. I gutted him anyway. And now, I'm sitting in front of my PC rolling my eyes at how badly this game wants to think of itself as ""mature"".
Also, the voice acting is inconsistent. Accents don't make sense. For some reason, every dwarf has the same Scottish accent as the Skellige Islanders do... despite the fact that not once did I see a dwarf in Skellige. Meanwhile, all the Novigrad people are Cockney (except for the nobles, whose accent is ""posh & gay""). But then there are people who've seemingly lived their whole lives in that city and have an American accent. Not to mention Geralt himself, who whisper-growls everything like Batman and sounds like he came from San Diego.
Geralt's character is clumsily developed at times. It's hard to buy into his eternal love for Yennefer (or Triss) when he's hanging out with Dandelion reminiscing about orgies, or when he's buying some poor Cockney girl in one of the many, many brothels. (Actually, all of the prostitutes in this game are 100% okay with being prostitutes. It's a lifestyle choice, and they demand you respect it.) Anyway, it's an awkward contrast.
The writing is also oddly political for a game set in medieval times. The entire Novigrad story arc is ""Geralt helps his SJW waifu protect immigrants from crazed religious bigots."" It's a weird questline. And really unbalanced. There's a very clear ""good side"" and ""bad side"", with no nuance at all. You either stop the bigots from murdering cross-dressing elves, or you're a terrible person and Triss hates you. Then, there's Yennefer's bizarre speech comparing prohibitions against necromancy to prohibitions against premarital sex‚Äîthey're both ""outdated"". Yes, she actually says that. Considering no one else in the game EVER condemns casual sex, it's a really weird comparison. Like, who ARE these mysterious sex-haters? Where are they? They can't be a religious group, the only religion is the crazed elf-murdering cult and they LOVE the brothels.
So yea, the writing and leveling made this game a solid 6/10 for me.",,ti1706,,,

The art and graphics are amazing, and the music really sets the mood, whether you are battling a pack of drowners, or flirting with the ""ladies"" in a brothel. I am running an old Alienware Aurora R7 with a GTX 1070 that I picked up about 2 years ago, and I can run everything on ultra-high, and the environment is (again) one of the best I have played in.
I won't keep going, because I am already beginning to sound like a broken record. It's not perfect... Sometimes a body will continue to ragdoll down a gentle slope when it should have stopped immediately. Today I walked into a nice, warm, cozy house, just to find that it was raining inside, even though it had a perfectly good roof. Riding your horse, Roach, is so awkward that I just run everywhere. A lot of people complain about the combat, but I like it just fine. However, I'm a 44 year old fart that uses a keyboard and mouse, instead of a controller, and I just can't keep up with the 12 year olds anymore. There are also hundreds of mods out there to change any aspect of the game you wish but, I have not used any of them to date so I cannot comment on their usefulness.
Overall, it is extraordinarily immersive and a must-have for single-player RPG fans. I'd give it a 9.7/10, and I am demanding from my games, so many would consider that score fairly harsh. In my opinion, there are just some things that should have been fixed before it was released. I have seen other reviewers say that they were not paid for their review, and since I know how to spell and use fairly proper English, I guess I will say that I was NOT paid for mine either (although I wouldn't mind knowing how that works:)).

A game where you can't design your character whatsoever (except for the hairstyle) with barely any choice or dialogue options shouldn't be called an RPG. It certainly has a nice atmosphere, but the story, exploration, combat and lack of roleplay elements simply bored me.

Even now, on my third-plus playthrough, I'm noticing things I never noticed before, or making realizations that I missed on earlier playthroughs. There's a lot of depth to the world and the storytelling, that just gets richer with each playthrough.
The world is extremely well fleshed-out, and even though the Witcher is based off a series of fantasy novels, I believe the game has far surpassed the source material in terms of world building and character development.

You will often find yourself going ""damn there isn't any room for this skill"" and that's just how it will be for most of the game.  However, your level does not significantly change combat.  if an enemy pops up and it has a skull don't feel afraid, you will be able to beat it with in a few tries. you can exploit the mechanics.

TL:DR
If you're like me and saw The Witcher's Netflix series and felt the need to boot up this beauty once more, welcome!
I've followed with A LOT of interest The Witcher 3 and partially the second entry in the franchise. Never had the PC to run this game and now I jumped to that chance and I'm so glad I did.
In a matter of weeks (1.5 to be exact) this game caught my attention, passion, sweat and tears, keeping me glued to the screen for well over 14 hours at times in one day thanks to its characters, quests, sidequests and just incredibly stunning world. It's just phenomenal.
I've known The Witcher saga for quite a while, played the first one well over a decade ago, just a couple of hours, but that was enough to keep me interested and that led to me spending quite a large amount of time watching playthroughs, story recaps, hell even memes about The Witcher's universe.
I finally managed to get myself a nice GOTY edition for this game and with a bunch of tweaks managed to get it running at a sort of stable 15-20 FPS (yup, PC Masterrace  member here), definitely playable, not enjoyable but playable.
Let's go for the traditional review now, I bored you enough with pointless details.
The Witcher games are based on the books, the stories take place after the events in the books. There will be near constant references to characters that appeared in both books and previous entries in The Witcher 3 (as expected) which will be overwhelming. Therefore I suggest watching some recap of the books and the games, if you really don't wanna spend a good 200+ hours on the games plus all the books.
You're playing as Geralt of Rivia, the White One, Butcher of Blaviken, Mutant, Freak, Sorceresses ...ehm, lover. You'll hear his name 12 times a minute,so don't worry, you won't forget it.
You're a badass witcher, strong mutated group of humans that, to put it as bluntly and as simply as possible, they are mercenaries that follow a moral code and the highest bidder, for both men and beasts.
The story is a pretty nice and long one, with a ton of characters, most of them likeable
that feel real, deep. You can see them change thanks or because of your actions, for the better or worse. Especially with the closer ones
you'll start feeling a connection, something that rarely happened in an RPG game to me before.
There's a lot of sidequests, and I mean a LOT of SIDEquests. There's plenty of games that call sidequests absolutely pointless quests that don't progress the story in anyway whatsoever, such as Skyrim, with simple, boring and repetitive fetch quests. Sadly
, but some are far more entertaining and memorable than others.
Some are contracts that you pick up in game, they're simple ‚ÄúGo to X, kill Z, go back to Y for reward‚Ä? some are what would be considered main quests in many other RPGs, with full cutscenes, actual story progress if completed, consequences (positive, negative and somewhere in the middle at times), choices that are legit HARD to make...
You'll get to choose if a terrible man should die or live (after he butchers hundreds of women and doing God knows what to their bodies), pretty simple choice right?
You'll get to choose if a village should die to help a bunch of orphans and the sick wife of one of your ‚Äúfriends‚Ä? friend that caused said woman to become crazy after he beat her and led to her miscarriage.
You'll get to choose whether helping or not
, while also finding dead bodies in her house, that she forgot to mention.
That's why I compared it to Yakuza earlier. Both games have a pretty intense and well-written story (some moments are better than others, yea. None are flawless in terms of writing and pacing), but the sidequests
make the game shine, and these quests are just as important as the main quests, especially since some have SEVERE impacts on the story later on!
The best aspect about this game (
) is the morally grey choices. Some situation
have a good outcome, both outcomes are bad, some more, some less. The choice between lesser and greater evil is not omnipresent in the game but it's there in some crucial points.
.
The whole concept of ‚Ä?‚Ä?is at the center of the game, it's up to you to choose between them.
The Witcher 3 is an RPG, with your usual skill tree, armor and weapon upgrading system via runes, same old same old. You can use (
) mutagens to make your builds even stronger, all thanks to the usual skill points obtained when levelling up / completing certain actions and killing certain enemies that grant you special upgrades.
You'll have plenty of branches to this skill tree.
Combat ‚Ä?Combat moves, special attacks etc.
Spells ‚Ä?Sign upgrades, radical changes to the way some spells work (tired of your pocket flamethrower? Make it a
Potions ‚Ä?OD while also becoming scary and ugly to look at, which has its buff, not like real life
Witcher (I guess that's the name?) - Various specific buffs
You'll need to min-max your builds, fully maxing out your character in every single stat is doable, just not on 1-time playthrough. Some builds are clearly stronger than others, but you can mix and match lots of cool upgrades, giving you some freedom during combat and sometimes outside of it too.
Speaking of combat is ‚Ä?well, functional. It works, it's not the game's strongest aspect. It ‚Ä?it just works. It's simple: light and strong attack, block and parry (parry timing is a bit clunky tho), spice it up with 5 spells [ [i] Magic trap (not as cool as it sounds), Fire, Shield, Mind-control and Force Push[/i] ] and with the special skills from your skill tree. It's quite the challenge (
) at the highest difficulty, Death March, but even at lower difficulties the game's no joke... early on at least. You're far too weak early on, and once the story picks up the pace, you're overlevelled for the last main quests, making it a bit too easy later on. You'll go down easily, even with a great build, standing in one spot like a sitting duck taking blow after blow simply isn't a thing (
). You gotta keep on moving, and Geralt will dance around the battlefield like a crazy sword wielding ballerina, looking hella cool while slicing and dicing whatever comes in your way.
When it comes to loot you got your usual gear progression, the simple, usual ‚ÄúThe higher level you are, the cooler and stronger the gear gets‚Ä? Nothing much to add to that. It's easy to understand, it works.
The controls are bad, on PC at least. They work well during combat, they do work there yea... but horse riding, platforming and moving around in tight areas with a keyboard is a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing pain. Your movements feel imprecise, clunky, which will then lead to falling... a lot. Fall damage is a true pain in the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô? download a mod to remove it as soo",,Darkfenerata 101,,,

Came back a couple years later due to Witcher series on TV and game it more of a proper go - I am still terrible at combat (gave up on Witcher 2 as couldn't make it past the tutorial on normal lol), but this is far more forgiving, less reliant on BS like oils, way more story and yeah it is looking like I might get to learn why people love this so much.
I would say I am about 12 hours in my second, real run on this, and yeah am barely scratching the surface i think - vastly better than previous witcher games (1 was collect all the girls you screwed cards, the game(tm), 2nd was no idea frankly as combat was too horrendous for me - this looks to be more of an epic, and if you suck at combat even more than me they even have an option to tone it down so much you can pretty much ignore it, which is nice really.

This game's biggest strength compared to titles heavily influenced by it, like Assassin's Creed: Odyssey, is that the side quests are actually interesting. They do a good job of generally avoiding pointless fetch quests. That's good, because you constantly get quests levels way above your current level. People criticized AC: Odyssey for XP grinding and content gating, yet I don't recall that being leveled against this game, which doe something fairly comparable. Puzzling.

Now for some of the issues:
Lighting inside houses and places that you're supposed to see well isn't that great and using the potion for seeing in the dark sometimes is still difficult.
The free market of trade is a bit one sided without an option to haggle for prices to go down or for what you're selling to go up. I'm a little peeved to sell something for 40 coin and then see to buy it back its worth 250..... inflation is legit a pain. but still manageable.
All in all i give it a 4.5 out of 5. The game play, scenery and story far surpass any issue I've come across and honestly while plying doesn't bother me to much. A game i can honestly say Id pay full price for and not flinch. Good hunting!!!",7.65612E+16,Greyskys,,,

I did not really enjoy my experience (other than the graphics) for the first 10ish hours. After not giving up due to how much people praised it, I can now finally see what others have saw in this game.
It's not really about the gameplay or characters, since both of those elements are just average in my opinion. This game is actually about the immersion, world building, creatures, graphics and beautiful music that suck you into this game until you play for 6-hours straight. I don't think I've ever been this immersed in a game to the point I will just sit back and listen to the beautiful music and slowly take in the world and explore...this is the reason why people have 200+hours into this game (that and there's a lot of content). As of writing this review i'm 37 hours in and have so much to do and I definitely see myself doing almost everything this game has to offer (except the gwent card game quests...).
I highly recommend this game to those who want to go on an incredible journey and get sucked into an immersive cinematic world filled with interesting monsters, locations,lore and a listen to a great soundtrack.

I kept my distance from this game for a number of years due to what I can only say was poor marketing and a bad experience trying to play the Witcher 2 (2 & 3 don't even compare and they're barely a continuous story).
I think my favorite part about this game is the amazing story that is nestled within the imperfect world. Evil/poor choices can be made that will lead to an awful ending, which makes achieving a good/bittersweet ending all the more satisfying. If you like epic soundtracks, this one is on par with best (Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, God of War PS4, Conan the Barbarian (1982).

-Traveling on horse is tedious? Horses will follow a path if you just hold A.
-Diving underwater is generally pointless? There are plenty of loot caches underwater.
-Shout upgrades are just more of the same thing? Signs can change function with levels.
-‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• storytelling? Not an issue.
-Boring, two-step puzzles? Let's add some sick riddles.
I have only one complaint, and that's the fact sometimes the game gives you the illusion of choice when in fact both/all options lead to the same outcome. But just as often, the choice matters. So it's jarring sometimes.",,DeceasedL0ved0ne,,,

But other than that:
Combat: 8/10. Good but feels to shallow often turning into a dodge and hit fight, there are spells you can cast which are useful in fights but other than that it feels like a watered down Dark Souls, but it's still fun.
Story: 10/10. The games strongest aspect in my opinion. Starts of veeerrryyy slow for the first 3+hours but once you get the first big main quest out the way the story picks up and gets really immersive the characters don't feel like copies of each other (aside from their models which 80% of the time are if there not a main character) the only time it loses pace a bit is near the end when you do this big battle only for it be revealed that was just the start then the game returns back to normal while you go get the items needed (although in this last act they focus more on character development especially between Ciri and Geralt which is always a welcome choice) to finish what started. there are also about 15+ ending combinations you can get off the top of my head
World 9/10 the world of The Witcher 3 is not the largest but there is plenty to do from completing some witcher contracts which just means monster hunting to completing the massive amount of side quests which by the way are all unique and well designed a lot of side quests do have an impact on the story or characters so if a character you like gives you a side quest be sure to complete it (especially if its from Yen or Triss)",,Cactus,,,

If you're anything like me, and you don't enjoy playing ""fantasy"" style games, then this game probably doesn't seem too appealing. I'm really happy to say I was wrong.
No doubt one of the greatest games ever made. Perfectly designed, written, composed, and casted, this game is essential for any and every gamer to play. It's perfect for those who love a good story, those who love to be completionists, and... YES, even for those who hate fetch quests, as this game has none! Don't believe me? Try it yourself.
And the DLC's are 100% worth playing and are arguably better than the base game. Each area introduced is perfectly laid out, as you can really tell the developers spent a lot of time refining this game. I HIGHLY recommend this game to any type of gamer.",7.65612E+16,Twitch.tv/DecidedAsh,,,

,2020-01-25,FALSE,,,,236.6,692,8,292030,69,TRUE,"I like a story driven game. About 40hrs in so far and the game is rich in epic tales and adventures in just the secondary quests alone.
I don't bother much with witcher contracts. I plan to get around to them at some point, but I've been far more interested in the side quests and story development. Hunting monsters for coin just seems kind of repetitive and dull after a while.
The card game 'Gwent' is very addictive. Only problem is that it isn't really fun to replay the same opponents after you've beaten them. I feel like I constantly have to search for the next strongest player and develop my deck further. Haven't been able to participate in high stakes games yet, but I'm looking forward to it.
The only negative thing I could say is that I'm not sure if I could bother with replaying the game a second time from the beginning. It's a large investment of time and I don't believe I'm halfway through the main story yet. The epic narrative keeps me involved like I'm watching a movie or TV series where the plot continues to develop and your anxious to see what happens next. But after experiencing something like that for the first time, it isn't the same going back through it a second time. Not sure that the actual game play and challenges are worth a replay. I'd undoubtedly skip through the cutscenes just to get tasks completed.
The fact that certain dialogue options can change the way events play out may be worth replaying just to see what choosing other options would change. I did end up failing a quest because I did't like the tone of the NPCs I was talking to, so I chose a dialogue option that was short tempered. We ended up fighting and I had to kill them. But I don't really feel like I missed out on much by not experiencing that quest, given that the game is so rich in other experiences.
Thoroughly enjoying this game so far. It's gonna suck when I finally reach the end. Doesn't seem like there's going to be a Witcher 4 coming out, so there isn't anything to look forward to after this, except for the series being developed on Netflix. After watching the first season I was left wanting more. That prompted me to buy the trilogy of games. Could't play the first game due to a bug where I just couldn't proceed to the next stage. May go back and try again. I was able to play and enjoy Witcher 2. Witcher 3 has been loads more fun.",,originalsandbox,,,

- Excellent story rich and story line is completely different by your choice making or optional quest to do leading to different ending scene (like me, I confront a worst ending in bloody baron quest, so sad).
- Gameplay is not bad but not very good because it will the same in every enemy (just dodge, use signs, drink potions and attack, so if you learn and know what potions are important to your combat, no way to lose). The game emphasizes at RPG based-story rich game.
- Exactly 100 hours++(including 2DLCs) for this game if you read all dialogue and wanna know all story line.
- So much worth for GOTY edition (no doubt for GOTY reward).
If you love to play RPG based-story rich just buy it then even when it's on discount, no need to think just click add to cart. Can be called it to be one of the best game in the last decade.

""No!""
Witcher 3 is a good game in the same way that a marvel superhero movie might accidentally be good. It's multi-million dollar, safe, focus-tested, corporate garbage for the masses. Literally its only purpose is to generate billions of dollars worth of profit from the low-IQ beer-guzzling McDonald's-eating ret.ards that outnumber real humans. Except this time, it also happened to be a good game.
But masterpiece? This AAA normie marvel tier game, no matter how good it is, will never even approach the level of masterpiece or cult classic of something like Bloodborne. Because its focus is too broad. Appeal to everyone, excel at nothing. That's its motto, and every AAA game's motto. If the game happens to be good, great! But it will never be a masterpiece. There is no soul. No master spark of creativity, which is the very life force and essence that the word ""masterpiece"" refers to. Someone had a vision, and painstakingly crafted an artistic achievement by infusing their very soul on a metaphysical level into the finished piece. Not so with Witcher 3. It is a product, not art, and it is corporate achievement, not an artistic one. And it is certainly no masterpiece.",,Kenku,,,

Graphics still look great even up against most brand new games. The story is probably one of the longest i've ever played. I love how in depth all of the side quests are and how naturally you seem to come across them. The size of the world is honestly overwhelming. When i started in the first area I was like ok this game is pretty big, then when you see that the game is several times larger its like omg idk if i can do all this. The gameplay is pretty smooth, and an obvious improvement compared to the previous games, but the spell and potion systems can get a bit complex for people who aren't used to this type of game. I'm really excited to get back into it, but the reason i originally stopped playing was the overwhelming scope of the game, and how basic all the swords and armour look.

I installed the Witcher 3 EE mod from the nexus and holy ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, the game is perfect. It had a steep learning curve but it is worth investing time into.
I honestly don't believe I will play a game that will ever meet that standard, if you have not tried it then I would highly recommend everyone try it. Improves on every aspect of the game, the RPG elements, the combat, the signs and alchemy.

To keep it simple the witcher 3s strengths to me were the customisation, the open world, the universe/lore and the combat. Geralt is a pretty cool character as well and there are some other likeable characters u meet throughout the story. I found the overall story average however with way too much dialogue and sitting there just listening to random characters blabber on about ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• u don't care about. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes open world games and in depth character customisation. This game also lasts quite a while, taking me about 60 hours to do the main story with a little bit of side quests and witcher contracts. I haven't played through the dlcs but they are supposedly quite long as well.
Pros
- Interesting world/lore
- Really smooth and satisfying combat with melee and magic
- Geralt being a beast
- Well optimised
- Lasts long which means it's actually worth the money, especially if its on sale
Cons
- Way too much pointless dialogue that makes the game weirdly paced
- Average story overall",,Kronos,,,

This game can be bought nowadays for $20, a playthrough of the entire game has taken me over 150 hours both times (once on console once on pc). Math isn‚Äôt my strong point but that‚Äôs a lot of value for money in terms of hours to dollars, let alone when you take into account that this game is written and directed to levels I personally didn‚Äôt think possible in a video game, from in-depth lore to the vast VAST (even vaster with blood and wine) open world, detailed and individual conversation pathways and choices that can lead to one of many vastly and significantly different endings to the storyline to references to other cdprojekt game's and even direct impacts to the world of witcher 3 based off of choices made in witchers 1 and two.
Visually in 2015 this game was a pc melter, console cooker and some people even compared the demands of the visuals to that of the Crysis series, because of this the game still holds up nicely nearly 5 years onwards, yes visually it will be outclassed by metro exodus and red dead redemption two but it‚Äôs far from a bad looking game and more often then not looks downright stunning, and those game's cost 4x more for fewer gameplay hours
Speaking of The gameplay, though simple, it is refined and encourages creativity in combat. Through the in-depth character customisation, levelling, skill tree and even just the various ways to play the simple yet effective combat system, much like the conversation system, encourages the player to truly become Geralt and mould his personality, character and physique to fit how the player wants to play the game to extents not before seen in the series. And that‚Äôs before you introduce the upgraded mutagen system from blood and wine.
Similarly to its competitor Skyrim, The Witcher 3 has had a release of two significant DLC contents over its lifetime each with sets of new enemies weapons armour boss fight and storylines that rival if not surpass the main story. If you enjoyed witcher books or other games or dark souls or Skyrim or even *Sigh* Netflix witcher you‚Äôll have nothing but love for this masterpiece, this is an absolute banger of a game and a game that is a must-have for anyone who enjoys RPGs.",7.65612E+16,Arthur Morgan Looking Confused,,,

I can gladly add with a smile on my face, another positive review for this game that has stolen most of my time just so that i could complete the main story and feel some satisfaction and closure.
The game is so emotionally attaching in which i truly feel that your choices heavily lie on how you would act in real life as a person. This is what makes this game special for me. For a game i purchased for ¬£7.50 i'm simply amazed by how much work and detail was put into the game to make it what it is.
I have so much love for the characters and there role in the story which made for a fitting ending to Geralts long adventure. I'm so glad i found this game due to enjoying and giving the Netflix series a watch. Thankyou CD Projekt from the bottom of my heart.

,2020-01-23,FALSE,,,,218.1,740,3,292030,92,TRUE,"Tl;dr Why haven't you bought this game? The entire package (which includes all of the DLCs) is regularly on sale for $15.00 - $20.00 and this game is worth $120.00 easily, without DLCs.
The world is immense (with the DLCs it's ridiculous), but at the same time detailed and filled with life (and loot). Everything seems like it belongs there, and the places feel lived in. Everything has a history and you can discover some of that while playing.
The story is incredible. Many different plots and intrigues are balanced against one another and interwoven, with Geralt and his (your) choices at the center, to create a truly unique experience. Somehow dozens, maybe hundreds of characters are presented in such a way as to not feel overwhelming, and none are made to be insignificant.
There are probably well over 1,500 quests throughout the Witcher 3 and it's DLCs. Most of these quests offer a unique and engaging experience, and even those that seem simple and boring can lead to major shifts in some of the plot-lines. You choose how you want to play the game, with many different options presented to you for dialogue. You can range from being a kind, lenient Witcher or you can be a complete a**hole. It's really up to you.
Finally, the combat is really good. If you only look at the sword play, it's relatively simple compared to other RPGs (i.e. God of War). You have a basic and heavy attack (with two other options available in the skill tree later on) and a quick dodge and roll, which is pretty run-of-the-mill for a modern RPG. However, when you take into account signs (simple magic spells) and potions, as well as the skill tree and mutation system, the gameplay becomes extremely open-ended, allowing for many, many different builds and playstyles.
I missed so much in this review. I could write ten pages of praise without even going into any details of the plot. I didn't even mention the 100s of different monsters and enemies you get to fight in this game, or the 100s of different mods that are available which can enhance your experience even more.

I am definetely going to read the books, and play through the game again with the hardest difficulty and with all of the dlc's.

,2020-01-21,FALSE,,,,70.8,762,4,292030,959,TRUE,"This game has waited to be played on my library for way too long. It's also a game that I've bought three times, because I intended to play it on consoles when it first came out. Needless to say, looking at how stunningly beautiful this game looks on PC with the maximum graphics, I left the console copies to gather dust.
Story, gameplay, audio, graphics... The Witcher 3 delivers top quality on each and every one of these segments. It'd be a waste of letters to go any deeper on to explaining how great any of those aspects are individually, so let's focus on the composition of them instead!
Game world feels very intact and provides lots of ground and water to explore. Vast amount of side quests varying from bigger quest chains to simple tasks located merely a 100 meters from quest givers are giving you a good reason to explore the world. There are only few RPG games which deliver actually interesting side quests, and Witcher has always stood up on the top of them. They do use the same character models for many of the unimportant characters, yet they manage to create an unique personality for each and every one, so not many become completely forgotten over the time.
Everything feels rewarding and the pace of the game is very well balanced. I do like the fact that you are not forced to immediately familiarize yourself with all the game's mechanics like alchemy and the use of mutagens if you decide to play on a lower difficulty level, because for me at least, chugging potions isn't something I do in any game in general. When going with a higher difficulty setting however, investigating the target of your hunt is mandatory along with choosing the right potions, oils and decotions for the job.
At the end of it all, The Witcher 3 delivers an unique experience that you'll want to keep playing for hours on end. It's familiarizing you with the world of Witchers without expecting you to have played the previous titles or missing out on the books. It's a game that doesn't demand a lot of skill to complete, yet provides a good challenge and a variety of things to master if you'd like to be challenged.
Only negative things I can say about the game are the few bugs here and there, which I have mostly encountered when having a conversation with merchants or blacksmiths (I've either got stuck to the dialogue or the shop hasn't opened at all - but this has happened about four times during my 70 hours in the game). Physics can work in weird ways at some points, especially if you're casting a flying monster off the sky using your Aard.
It's also worth mentioning some of the more cinematic cutscenes tend to look very bad in comparison to the ones generated in-game using your current outfits for both Geralt and the alternative ones for Yen, Ciri and Triss as well. When your in-game graphic settings are all maxed out, the cinematics look like they're coming from some of the earlier games. Sound design is also very poorly constructed in certain scenes towards the end, where they could be much more epic and have a lot more impact if they were given an tiny bit of an improvement.
Still, a very strong recommendation for everyone who enjoys a good RPG - you don't want to miss out on The Witcher 3!",,prodEx,,,

,2020-01-21,FALSE,,,,504.9,763,0,292030,84,TRUE,"Our hero Geralt is a witcher, a monster hunter trained since childhood to be fearsome warriors, skilled in combat, tracking, magic, and more. Witchers are given mutagens to make them stronger, faster, and resistant to toxic alchemy. Geralt, also known as the White Wolf, is the protagonist of the Witcher novels and games. He has a relationship with Triss Merigold, and his personality and politics are largely left up to the player. Witchers are meant to remain detached from conflict without taking political sides, but in the first two Witcher games, Geralt often has to make a choice between aiding humans or the persecuted non-humans. As mutants, witchers comfortably fit in neither camp. At the beginning of the first Witcher game, Geralt is found near the Witcher stronghold of Kaer Morhen, wounded, with his memory stolen by amnesia. Geralt recovers his memory over the course of The Witcher 2 and recalls that he was killed by a pitchfork-wielding villager while defending a group of nonhumans. His former lover, the sorceress Yennefer, died trying to bring him back. But both were saved by Ciri‚Äôs magical powers, and they lived in peace until Yennefer was taken by the Wild Hunt. Geralt tracked them and made a trade: his life for Yennefer‚Äôs. She was freed, and Geralt rode with the Hunt until he somehow made his escape, which is where The Witcher 1 picks up. When Geralt discovers Yennefer is alive, he sets out to find her.There are a lot of country and city names thrown around in the first few hours of The Witcher 3, and even if you remember those names from previous games, you may not remember where everything is. So, MAPS! The large map to the right, made for The Witcher 3, depicts the portions of the Northern Kingdoms explorable in The Witcher 3. When The Wild Hunt Begins, the Empire of Nilfgaard has invaded the Northern Kingdoms from the south, occupying large swaths of territory. The Witcher 3 is mostly set in the center of this conflict, in the southernmost part of the Northern Kingdoms. One of those kingdoms is Temeria, where The Witcher 1 is set, and it has already been conquered by Nilfgaard. The map below shows the boundaries of the Northern Kingdoms before the events of The Witcher 3, and depicts the land to the north of Novigrad that isn‚Äôt visible in The Witcher 3‚Äôs map. The significant kingdoms here are Redania and Kaedwen, who are still at war with the invading Nilfgaard.That's a ton of background information, so you're probably wondering where does The Witcher 3 fit into all this. The game primarily takes place on the Temerian-Redanian border and Skellige. Your goal is to find Ciri before a mysterious group called the Wild Hunt does. However, the region is currently locked in a brutal war between the Temerians and the Nilfgaardians. Battlefields are piled high with corpses, and many of the common folk have been displaced. The politics in these games can be tough to follow, but we like to think this was intentional for a few reasons. First, Geralt, being the good Witcher he is, shouldn't meddle with politics--emphasis on ""shouldn't."" Second, there are no good guys or bad guys in the world of The Witcher; it's kings and queens mobilizing the poor to fight for them. Finally, real-world politics are messy, and for this world to feel believable, the politics present should be dirty as well. You could play through this whole game and still not understand why Nilfgaard is at war with Temeria, and that's okay. The Witcher 3 is about Geralt, Ciri, and their friends. The more context you have, the better, but to some extent, being confused about the state of the world is an integral part of the experience.Though one thing to keep in mind is that ordinary folk typically don't trust Witchers, sorceresses, and non-humans simply because they're different. The so-called free state of Novigrad is currently in the middle of a bloody witch hunt. Sorceresses and non-humans are being burned at the stake. The surviving dwarves, elves, and sorceresses are being pushed into ghettos or forced to go into hiding. While there's no law against Witchers yet, most people are scared or intimidated by Geralt when they see him. The hatred for non-humans and sorceresses can be traced to the Church of The Eternal Fire and King Radovid. The Eternal Fire was founded in Novigrad, and its followers believe that the Eternal Fire will guide them through hardships. They also hate non-humans, sorceresses, and monsters. While King Radovid seems relatively indifferent towards non-humans, he specifically hates sorcerers and sorceresses, especially one named Philipa Eilhart. Because of this, King Radovid turns a blind eye to the Church of Eternal Fire's intolerant behavior. Presumably, as a result of the hatred and violence brewing from this social climate, the Lodge of Sorceresses is a shell of its former self. The once-powerful group of sorceresses played a significant role in the realm's politics. Although some of their tactics were shady, many of them advised kings and influential people. Currently, its members are dead or in hiding. However, the game doesn't begin south of the Novigrad and Redanian border. After a lengthy tutorial segment in White Orchard, you start your quest in Velen; a war-torn region commonly referred to as No Man's Land. Here you will find a series of small, impoverished villages under the watchful ""protection"" of the Bloody Baron. Meanwhile, Geralt's friends are scattered around the region. Triss was last seen in Novigrad; Yenn, after your short introduction to her, is chasing up leads in Skellige; and Dandelion is missing. As Geralt, you must search for Ciri and your friends while navigating the world's tumultuous political climate and hidden conspiracies. There's much to uncover, but everything we've detailed should be more than enough to prepare you for the massive journey ahead.

Combat mechanics aren't the best, and the way leveling works means that you'll pretty constantly be looking to improve your gear which distracts from the main point--the story. The quests and story are, however well worth playing.

Great combat, although not quite as crisp as I am used to from games like Dark Souls, incredibly well written and interesting characters and awesome questlines.
Especially exceptional  is IMO, that the choices actually feel meaningful and the game doesnt destroy that like so many others by a binary ""good option bad option, here are your light/dark side points and your ending"" mechanic. The choices are hard ones to make and there is no clear right or wrong, you will often leave wondering ""have I done the right thing?"".
It is also one  of the few games that get open world right, by giving you a vast world to explore but still keeping that world small enough to be able to keep it interesting.

NOTE: You are NOT IN NEED to read all the books and played the last 2 games before this to start your first adventure in this universe. So if you are totaly new, it is totaly okej and the game is made with that in mind. I recommend not to rush this game.
*The world in this game is built with love, respect and life. You will notice it clearly while playing it. Enjoy every ""?"":mark on your map. Do as many (rec: ALL) side quests as possible. Visit every town and accept all the witchers contracts. Why you may ask... Well to be completely honest, the side quests, free roam adventures, people you meet and talk to, random encounters with monsters, spirits, ghastly looking nightmares are absolutely masterful crafted. Everything is living, breathing things that bring a ""real"" soul to the game. They are NOT boring and filled with suprises to keep you entertained.
*You can replay the game like a NEW GAME+. Great thing to explore the game in nooks and cranies where you havent done before.
*The story is well done and great written! To have good progress and understanding i recommend NOT to skip dialogs and choose the ""white options"" before you continue with the ""yellow"" ones in the dialogs.
Enojy the game like it where you who was the witcher Geralt of Rivia. Enojy the game for what it is, a absolute masterpice. Will hold the crown of being the best RPG in year to come.
PS.
Do not blame CDPR and The Witcher when you have completed the game once (or more?) and no other game like it will satisfy you as much ;) Happend to me xD

Let's break it down, shall we?
- The graphics in this game is fantastic. It's beautiful and stunning, you could walk around, watching the trees swaying around and relax yourself just by watching and admiring the landscape.
- The combat system is also fun. Some mini bosses will make you think before attacking, and the bosses also very challenging, each one of them. (Well except if you are fighting a lower level boss). You can use potions and oils which will help you fight against certain of monsters.
- The missions. - so far I am yet to finish the main mission of the game, still finishing the side missions. No, the side missions are not like what you think it is, its fun, you can make contracts which you will be fighting a rare monster (this one is so challenging), help most people in need, some fetch quests (of course), you can also be an actor in a play.
- The soundtracks - oh boy I love it, from boss music, fighting music, different areas, you will stumble upon that one soundtrack that will just scare the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• out of you. It's very fitting to the atmosphere and I love it
- The world is so immersive - from the small village of White Orchard to the No Man's Land of Velen, you will feel like you are inside the game. People working around, children are playing and singing, the birds chirping. I am absolutely speechless. It's also an open world game but some parts are separated.
- Skill tree - it's simplistic, and easy to understand. You can go with different builds, go offense, or magical etc.
- Don't know how to fight this certain enemy? Or anything in general? There's a bestiary where you can read about monsters and other magical creatures. You can read about their weaknesses and strategize before going for the monster bounty. And there's also a toturial tab where it will explains back what you just missed in the first toturial.
Okay here's the negative part.
- Button to do things. It's very hard to loot something sometimes, you need to dance around near the object to let the use button to appear or else you can't even loot it or use it. It's annoying
- The shop/armorer/blacksmith icon disappear from the world map. Are you kidding me? aren't those icons suppose to show up because I've already discovered them? God damn it! now I need to circle around the town to find that armorer back.

One of the best WRPGs out there, I put it on par with top series like Elder Scrolls, Fallout and Dragon Age.
Compared to Witcher 2, this one is a massive improvement in every possible way!
Fun combat, massive and extremely detailed open world, cool and interesting main, secondary and even minor characters, around at least a hundred sidequests that range from simple errands to actually well written sidestories, beautiful graphics and it all runs perfectly due to how good the game was optimized(which is rare for PC games), etc etc etc.
This is one of the few games that has a lot of pros and not many cons, and its hard for me to even think of something bad to say about Witcher 3 so I might as well not say anything.

When I first played it, I thought I'd sort of slide into it and acclimatise, like I did and still do with a lot of other games. Sadly, this wasn't true for any of the Witcher games including part three. Despite the gorgeous graphics and high detail, the story feels way too linear, battle mechanics make me feel like a console person, not being able to save where and when you want is an unnecessary pain in the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô?inside a singleplayer game and the fact that you can't wield any weapon you find seems a bit off. Also, a first person mode would have been an immersive addition to such a great open world. It's obviously a huge game with lots of good ideas and character, but to me it feels like getting off on the wrong foot each time I play it.

I frankly had no interest in this game other than the fact that the graphics were breathtaking (and still are in 2020) and that the game was rated well. I had no interest in the witcher, or even sword fighting for that matter. So it would have taken a lot to impress me but let me tell you I was and still am blown away.
This game combines the most important aspects of a single player RPG combat game. The combat is fun, there are many different ways to fight and lots of different perks and boosts to help you in your battles if you invest the time to find/brew/unlock them. The progression system is well thought out allowing one to focus on any different playstyle at once but also allowing one to spec into just one. The loot and drops are balance and keep the fights exciting for the loot at the end. I could go on about this but I'll go now to the story, which is awesome. Not only are all the characters both prominent and interesting, but their fates are decided by you, the player. You want to rush through the game just to find out what happens to your friends and your enemies.

The Witcher 3 is a game that defies all logic and has zero flaws that matter. The game is so good in fact, that a part of me doesn't recommend it because every other game will look mediocre by comparison. The only possible negative I can find is the lighting is a bit too dark inside buildings, but that might just be me.

Did I enjoy those fifty hours? Not really, no. Witcher 3 feels like a single-player MMO -- it's *designed* to waste your time and make you feel like you're accomplishing things, when in fact you're just mindlessly following the golden quest marker on your minimap.
What made me uninstall and write this review was when, after killing a beast and needing to return to town to get the quest reward, I got on my horse and *literally* did nothing but hold the A button for a full minute while my horse auto-pathfinded back to town.
The writing isn't terrible, if you like fairly generic fantasy stories, but the story-telling is brought down by the terrible animation during cutscenes, with lots of awkward silences and NPCs wobbling around in their idle animations.
Combat is brain-dead; every enemy has one or two attacks they do in a *very* repetitive pattern. Normal combat flow is: strong attack, two quick attacks, roll back to avoid the attack they launch.
Despite being a massive game, I never experienced a sense of mystery or felt the desire to explore; almost everything you can do shows up as question marks on your map. Although it's a little bit like comparing apples to plums, Breath of the Wild is a much better game in this regard.
A lot of the game systems are just annoying. Alchemy -- the crafting of potions and whatnot -- takes ingredients, mostly flowers or mushrooms you find growing out in the world. But in the game engine, plants are containers, meaning you press A on a flower and it opens the container menu and you have to press A again to gather it.
Using potions is another hassle -- although there are a lot  of different ones with a variety of interesting effects, you only have 4 potion quick-use slots. You can't use potions straight from your inventory, so you *have* to put them in a slot first, which is annoying. Even worse is that every time you open your inventory it resets what tab you're on so you have to re-navigate to the potions tab if you want to switch it out again. And worst of all, since there's so many, they all kind of blend together, and so if you want to use that one potion you remember having, you have to select it, wait half a second for the description to pop up, select the next one, etc. If you're unlucky, you'll have to do that twenty or thirty times before you find the one you wanted.
In summary: this game is vast but shallow and poorly designed, but also cunningly crafted to hit your dopamine receptors as often as possible. Playing this game will be massive waste of your time.",,kingcritter,,,

I've played the previous two installments and both were great in some aspects and lacking in others, meanwhile the third makes up for pretty much everything. The story is extremely engaging and really makes you feel the moral weight of some of the choices you have to make and the consequences since nothing is truly black/white. The gameplay is fun and enjoyable aside from it's occasional clunky moments, also on higher difficulties it really is extremely engaging doing various builds and using plenty of the oils and potions making you truly feel like a witcher. The world is beautiful and fun to explore and there's plenty to do and see with monster contracts, side quests, treasure hunts, and of course Gwent. Overall the base game is amazing, it's fun, engaging, immersive, and exciting. It truly does make you feel like you're Geralt.
I'll also include opinions of both DLC's below.
Hearts of Stone is an interesting experience and adds a bunch of more things to do to the one major area, as well as adds a whole new in game enchantment mechanic which adds something new to combat. It's not extremely long but it's challenging and interesting, also the potential sword you can receive as a reward is incredible. I will add another 10-15 hours of fun to what you've already enjoyed.
Now Blood and Wine is a different beast. This adds a ton of new content being a whole new area, enemies, items, and combat mechanic to the game. Enough to almost be it's own game in itself. It's story is fantastic and also helps new players become even more familiar with the previous lore of the series. The new creatures are both a nice change and also challenging at times. The new mechanic of mutations adds a whole new level to the combat and builds, and to top it all off Toussaint is absolutely beautiful. This will add hours of things to do and chase in both quests, contracts, and most of all Gwent.
Overall it's a fantastic game with excellent expansions. Outside of a few gameplay flaws and rare bugs this game is a gem and easily one of the best games of the past decade. A must play and must buy.",,Diick Damage,,,

The music complements your surroundings so well.
A calm, melancholic flute singing a story of the barren mountains' and ruin's bygone days while you gallop through them on your horse- it's breathtaking.
The intense buildup of drums and the battle cry of a valkyrie while you fight a battle against a wild monster- it's epic.
One of the best soundtracks I've heard from a game (Seriously though, have a listen to Kaer Morhen and Fields of Ard Skellig).
I like games with characters that make me feel strong emotion toward them. That way I know they are written well enough to motivate me to push through the story. Every major character is unique with personalities and contributes to the plot in a way that will influence your decisions by poking your emotions. This is one of those games that do a great job at this.
Can I also mention how great the facial animations are? I can tell CDPR put extra effort in the facial animation in moments where it really mattered. They deserve praise for that.
Now, there's a chance you're reading reviews to see if the purchase would be worth your money. My answer is yes, absolutely. Even more so when on sale.
I finished the main story at my own pace in a little over 100 hours. I've completed Hearts of Stone expansion in about 20 hours. I still haven't near finished the Blood and Wine expansion. So again, yes. It's one of the most satisfying purchases on a game.

TL;DR The Witcher 3 is by far the best game that I have ever played. Story rich, dialogue-interactive cutscenes, RPG, enjoyable gameplay, Masterpiece.
This game has beautiful interactive cutscenes and the dialogue choices that you choose can carry consequences. The gameplay is dynamic and allows the player to choose which skills to prioritize, which swords to use, which oils and concoctions to use, etc. I personally enjoy using Witcher signs so I invested skill points into the sign intensity skills. The game's hardest difficulty is very challenging and will require a fair bit of patience as well as knowledge and skill. However, the game truly shines with the lore. It is story rich with depth and was a very enjoyable play through. This is a game where you can expect to play through the story multiple times since it is THAT good; I know I have. Overall, this is the best game I have ever owned on Steam and still enjoy playing it today. Pick it up and play it; you won't regret it. DLC's are an added bonus!

Along the way, you run into former (current? up to you!) lovers, old friends, and questionable allies who help you get closer to finding her.
This game is pretty easy to get the hang of on ""easy"" mode. The hardest part for me has been getting the walking down; I've often walked *just* past characters to talk to and boxes to loot, and needed to turn around to try again. I'm also uncoordinated, in general, so this is accurate to me irl.

Combat is kind of boring to me since every type of enemy shares its own fighting pattern. Don't get me wrong, it's neat how each enemy is different, but it means enemies are predictable once you memorize the pattern (which doesn't take long). As someone who's never played any other Witcher games, the plot is confusing. That's not the game's fault, it's mine. So I recommend watching/playing the other games because I, personally, am confused. Let's see what else.... Graphics are nice (got some good screenshots). The game runs fast on my somewhat lousy gaming laptop. Roach is a pain in the rear end to control IMO. Even when he's ""on autopilot"" I get annoyed with controlling him. Roach is the horse BTW.

You could get by if you skipped all of that, including the witcher 1 & 2 summary, but you might find yourself a little lost to many of the major characters and references.

Pros:
For a game that's almost 5 years old, this is an absolutely gorgeous game. It has a very lengthy storyline that really gives you a run for your money. Choices you make in game affect the outcome of the storyline so you might be inclined to play it multiple times. There's a lot to this game that you'll have to learn: crafting, potions, armor, mutations, and let's not forget Gwent. If you're going to play this game, don't expect to know how to play it in a single afternoon. One thing I really love about it is how large the map is and how there are so many places to explore.
Cons:
There are a few downsides, primarily the controls. Good lord, the controls are awful at times. When I first picked up the game, I couldn't grasp my head around why there was so much input lag. Turns out, that's just a feature of the game smh. Trying to get roach to move is painful as there's a delay for when you want him to sprint. Many times, he'll just stop on his own which is annoying. The worst part is trying to swim. I almost died because I was stuck under a rock while under water. Also, this is the type of game you play for the story, not combat. The combat isn't very exciting as it's very repetitive. Most of the time, It's just me jumping around, button mashing the dodge button while trying to sneak in attacks. If you really value a unique combat system, this game is not for you.
Conclusion:
This game is for people who value a great story and fantastic scenery over exciting game mechanics and combat. I absolutely recommend the DLCs, but wait for them to be on sale.",,Axiproto,,,

I'm glad I watched the tv series (directly based on the books) before getting to the heart of this story, because ive never seen a video game that provides more faithful continuity to its original property. In addition to standing on its own as an unforgettable piece of well written, acted and visually directed story, it continues and even concludes plotlines from the books/episodes in a fitting and fulfilling way.
And that is just the main plot. I cant say enough about the threads that bind this together as a video game, and as a living, breathing world to explore. Many others have already said it better than I could.
While I wish it had a more complex combat system, battles are exhilarating and satisfying. Many side quests are so immersive you dont care about the reward or exp, you just want to see what happens next. The hard hitting choices you make when deciding the fate of  these well acted NPCs, even the random quest guys, might weigh on you long after their time in the story is done.
If you enjoy open world action games and RPGs, be it BotW, Skyrim, on down to the AC series, you will find here a shining example of the genre done right. If you havent been exposed to the Witcher universe yet, I recommend you watch the series on Netflix and then see that plot be brought to a brilliant conclusion in this game.",7.65612E+16,M11,,,

In some areas it absolutely excels, such as the narrative, acting, writing, the length of plot in quests.  But in other areas it feels like a game made by absolute amateurs.  Such as fighting mechanics, balance, menus, itemization.
In a  lot of ways the game has an entertainment value that's worth overlooking its short comings. The characters and world is well fleshed out and very immersive.  But for someone like myself who is a life long game player and a fan of action games and action RPG's there are some serious serious novice mistakes made in this game.  So much so that if you're really picky about that sort of thing you'd be hard pressed to finish this game.
Starting with the Cons.
The combat system is a real fine example of Form over Function.  You can tell it was designed by artists not designers of action gameplay mechanics.  There is a strong focus on the look and fluidity of combat but this comes at an immense expense of loose controls and lack of real player options.  There are systems in the game that have you constantly pause combat to apply oils to your weapons for added damage or menus to move through different spells that instead of playing off each other are used as specific spells against specific monster weaknesses.  So if you don't remember what a monster is weak to you have to pause combat, go into your glossary (bestiary) file through a cluttered menu to find the monsters info, apply oil, equip spell, and finally unpause the game.  This kind of design is something teachers in a Game Design school 101 should use as a clear example of how NOT to make an action oriented game.
Menus in the game are very poorly designed and there are an astonishing amount of items to pick up and grab that just become a blur of ingredients for alchemical recipes you don't have.  Again many of these choices are about the LOOK of the Witcher instead of how it feels to play.
There are many more cons to the combat and action and menus I could nitpick but you get the idea.
The pros are for sure the dialog, acting, writing, and overall plot and feel of the world.  Much of the craftsmanship and focus of the game is obviously in this department.  It's just a shame they didn't have anyone in the gameplay design room who knew anything about video games.
Overall if you can buy the game on sale it is a fun world to experience.  But don't listen to fanboys drool on and on about this game being amazing.  In my opinion only a really novice player of action games with ill formed opinions would find a game like this well made.",7.65612E+16,BeefSUPREME,,,

I keep thinking I'm at the end of the game, but it just keeps going. I was letting it drag out for a while as I was trying to complete all the side quests, but now I'm trying to finish the game and it seems that there is no end. Every time I think the main plot missions will be the last, it leads me to another quest to get one more person or piece of the puzzle. I like it that it's not just an easy end.

Gwent is something that is difficult to pick up, but when you get the hang of it and get some good cards. It immediately becomes addicting and almost as rewarding as beating a difficult boss. I found myself lost in these Gwent matches, wanting more and trying to get even more powerful cards.

I highly recommend it. As an aside, I understand that this game ties far more into the canon of the book series than the first two.

recommend playing them in order. For starters, there are references to past games, and your choices there can have an impact on the events of subsequent games. Additionally, the control scheme is better with each game, and you likely will not want to go back.",7.65612E+16,Beta Singularity,,,

I will mention now that I found out about mods about a quarter of the way through the main game, Im using a mod manager to launch the game and this disables steams time tracker I assume.The hours shown on my profile are not accurate, Im not sure how many hours I play honestly, but its probably around 60 or 70, okay to the review:
Nearly 8 years after its initial release, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt has held up as if Yrden was used on the entirety of the fanbase, even newcomers to the franchise as myself. I have rarely had an instance where The Witcher 3 DIDN'T pop up in a conversation for ""What do you think the best game this decade was?"". Rightfully so I may add. Starting my first game save only a week ago, I didnt ever think I could be entertained by an open world like this. From the start of the game to the end of ONLY the main story, I was hooked and hated having to take breaks from the game. After beating the game and swallowing the hard truth that its time to find a new game, the games main menu and Quest screen caught my eye with Blue and Red tints. After the sole game, CD PROJEKT RED did something that game companies 7 years later have struggled with doing, Im looking at you Division 2... The Witcher 3 somehow managed to re open up the creative and thriving continent that we love for their DLC, ""Heart of Stone"" & ""Blood and Wine"". While I have only completed Heart of Stone, I can say I am a few missions into Blood and Wine and am still somehow glued to my screen more than ever. The Witcher 3 is an 8 year old breath of fresh air that is without a doubt a pathway for the now delayed Cyberpunk 2077 to excel in the genre.
TLDR: Buy the game and enjoy every last minute of it. and dont forget to Toss a coin to your Witcher.
Edit: I completely forgot to mention the well thought out skill system that allows you to have many different combinations of skills and mutagens that each give a unique boost of health/intensity of sings aswell as gives Geralt new abilities that are only active when activated into your skill tree.",7.65612E+16,Panduh,,,

The Witcher 3 offers an enormous amount of quests, choices, outcomes, and character lines.  You could play the game 5 times and have a completely unique experience for every playthrough.  Every interaction is fully scripted and most have multiple dialogue options.  The choices you make affect almost every aspect of the game.  There are hundreds of unique armor sets, weapons, scabbards, crafted swords and gear, and leveling sets of witcher armors.  I have over 260 hours played on the Steam version (and I originally played this game on console) and I'm still only at about 40% completion.  With the addition of mods, the game can be whatever you want, and you can still collect achievements through the process.  CD Project Red developed a game that was easy to create, merge, and script mods for. My most recent playthrough has been as Henry Cavill's Witcher.

Well, i started the game with medium hopes since i had just finished binge watching the entire first season of the Netflix adaptation and went in. A sidenote, my pc is relatively a beast and could handle the game on ultra without a single problem so i could also appreciate the graphic side. Continuing on, the first 2 or 3 hours of the game had me still trying to find in me whether i actually loved the game or was simply hyped about jumping into a fresh universe. Well, after 140 hours of gameplay within 20 days i can safely say that this has been my best purschase in a very very long time, and i got 200 games in my library. The world feels alive, yet dark in some cases, it makes you laugh some times and other feel sorrow for its inhabitants. The voice acting is really well done, the graphics are superb, the storyline is also a solid 9/10 and the size of it all is imense. The DLCS are another devil of their own and deserve their own review respectively. If you get the chance to get this 2015 masterpiece do it without a moments hesitation.

P.S. It is so damn refreshing to have a game that's actually adult themed, and not afraid of it. More of this please, less of the ridiculous ""Coffee"" mod uproar.",,RogueJoe,,,

The amazing almost flawless story paired with a well thought out gameplay loop and mechanics are a nice change from other RPGs. Actually this game Puts some AAA ""RPGs"" to shame with decisions playing a huge part in how the world and loot and your character changes throughout the game.
The Story is amazing with a nice and consistent tone and characters feel like organic human beings not just some drones only living to play out role like sell, be a gang leader or be a disposable guard. Instead everyone has feelings and their own interests making a huge impact in how you play the game.
But it does not stop there the Blood and Wine expansion is also a perfect example of what expansions/dlc are meant to be introducing a new land with a completely different color palette which is a nice change form the main games gloomy feel. That and the massive amount of content and rich story line makes this one of the best dlc or expansion to ever be released for a already amazing game.",7.65612E+16,Conixon,,,

- Be patient for the first 10 levels, as leveling up at the beginning of the game (White Orchard) is extremely slow.
- Sign casting mechanic is quite awkward if you want to cast different signs in quick succession. Try googling for ""instant sign casting witcher 3"" and you'll find a better mechanic, whether you're using a controller or a kb/mouse combo. As for myself, I created a new steam controller configuration, so that L1 and R1 buttons are used for instant casts and shortcuts.
- Playing this game with a controller will have a smoother experience than a kb/mouse combo. Navigating around the game with a mouse is possible, but erratic mouse movements is just headache-inducing, imo. The ""motion blur"" setting in Witcher 3 doesn't seem to be as effective as ones in other games (e.g., Jedi Fallen Order is much more playable with a mouse, but then again it's a much more recent game).",7.65612E+16,b0nyb0y,,,

Don't get me wrong the game is good, it's really good but not a masterpiece.
Why? Because it has minor yet existing bugs (design flaws?) which break the immersion/atmosphere at least imo.
Just a few that I encountered so far:
- can't leave conversation screen with Esc button, only with numeric keys
- sometimes can't use AXII's Puppet upgrade/subskill. It doesn't matter how long I press Q it just doesn't work (often).
- also, when using Puppet time slows down for the player and the mobs too (at least it seems), however sometimes non-targeted mobs are not slowing down so you don't have enough time to perform the sign.
- once again the Puppet spell: WHO WAS THE I-D-I-O-T who think that 3-4 seconds are needful to cast that spell??????! If EVERY mob would slow down, maybe it would make sense but NO (see above)!
- Roach the horse 1. Oh boy talking about stupid AI. Instead of the demanding hair animations CDPR should have worked more on AI. You can't jump on Roach while running because he CAN'T KEEP UP / CAN'T CATCH UP!
- Roach the horse 2. ""Roach can follow the road if you hold down shift button (only)"".
Yes but he can't follow the road which LEADS TO THE QUEST's mark FFS! (Where were the testers at this point??????!)
- Conversation screen. I you start talking to some NPC (mostly merchants, blacksmiths) it doesn't turn to you but YOU TELEPORT in front of it! Thanks to this ""awesome"" mechanic/FEATURE(!!!!) sometimes I end up places where it's difficult to get out from.
So that was my rant based on the FANTASTIC features I encounter so far.

Let me just say that I have amassed around 500-600hrs in this game on all platforms. I bought the PC Version a while back but never got around to playing it on PC properly. I have recently decided to replay the game in its entirety on PC.
This game is a goddamn masterpiece. Everything from the graphics to storytelling is top-notch, the character development is in-depth and captivating to say the least. And after the amount of time I have spent playing the game on all platforms, I'm still not bored by The Witcher 3. IT IS THAT GOOD.
Oh and not only is the base game incredible, the DLCs are works of art! Blood and Wine especially, it blew my freaking mind!
There is a reason this game has such a massive following and insanely high reviews. CDPR have poured their hearts and souls into developing this game, they know exactly what the fan base are looking for and mold the in-game experience based on that. Kudos to you CDPR, you absolute gods XD
Overall, this game is a MUST BUY even for people that don't enjoy these styles of games, it might just change your minds *giggle* ;)

The game has excellent level and world design, with plenty of variety and realism. Still looks great in 2019.
Music:
Nice variety of musical scores, all well done and not boring.
Voiceovers:
One of the best games I've heard when it comes to voiceovers. They've done everything right here.
Story:
Fantastic story with some twists and turns. Plenty of sidequests all over the map that encourages exploration and helps to immerse yourself in the character. Lots of content that is new and doesn't go back to old cookie cutter stuff.
Gameplay
This game is a joy to play. It is a lot of fun traversing the different areas of the large map, fighting swarms of well placed, and interesting enemies. This really is it's own world that doesn't simply copy and paste ideas from other RPGs.
You can choose to do the large number of sidequests, or skip them entirely and head straight down the main quest line. The Choose-Your-Own adventure style of choices presented in the game offer good replay value. Some of those choices do affect the world at large, including the end game content.
Gripes:
The combat gets quite repetitive, and involves far too much dodging and rolling around to evade enemy attacks. It is more aggravating button mashing and luck than strategy. If you are lucky, you can kill enemies well above your level, but you are going to sit there for 20 minutes doing it, which is often not worth it.
While many of the items and loot drops in the game are not level dependent, weapons and armors do scale to your character level. Facing off with difficult enemies way above your level may be a fun challenge, but is ultimately unrewarding since you will only receive weapon and armor for your current level char.
If you are a player that likes to grind, this is not the game for you. Nearly all relevant experience comes from doing the main questline. Likewise, perform subquests before you are at a reasonable level can hamstrimg your character.
Otherwise, great game.",,Asmo6035,,,

- Over 9000 (weight limit set to 9000)
- Unlimited durability (stops equipment from breaking)
- Better torches (move and fight with torch in hand)
- Use The Witcher 3 Mod Manager and Script Merger to make sure your mods don't break the game (for this list, no action is required)
- mods to consider: ""ReducedFallingDamage"" and ""AutoLoot"" and ""Slots Slots SLOTS""
- alternate Axii sign does not work, if you are using Delusion (first upgrade for Axii that makes it better in dialogues). Fix:
Navigate to your folder: C:\Users\<User Name>\Documents\The Witcher 3
Open the file ""input.settings""
Find all the entries for ""IK_Q=(Action=CastSignHold,State=Duration,IdleTime=0.2)""
Change the entry to have an IdleTime of 0.1. So after your change it should look like this:
""IK_Q=(Action=CastSignHold,State=Duration,IdleTime=0.1)""
There are 3 entries that you have to change. Use Ctrl + F to find them quickly.
- I recommend using the alternate movement-style from CDPR, the other one is just too annoying

,2020-01-16,FALSE,,,,40.7,917,5,292030,112,TRUE,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a game I've been putting off for a while. Either due to not playing the original two, it's clunky controls, or it's large open-world that goes on and on with no seeming end in sight. For working a full-time job, it can be a daunting task.
Fortunately, after watching Netflix's The Witcher I gave it another chance - and boy do I regret not playing it earlier. While many have already graced us with raving reviews, I hope to provide a bit of insight from someone who has a full-time job, has barely any time to play many games, but decided upon this one.
After watching The Witcher, it gave me a real sense of the world I was jumping into. Nilfgaard, Mages, Witchers, Temeria, and the like. Many people who look for the Skyrim itch, The Witcher can seemingly scratch - but it's more than just that. The Witcher brings forth lore that is easily digestible, characters that you can get to know and appreciate. Playing this game felt more like watching Netflix's The Witcher more than playing a game, which I thoroughly enjoyed as I could break between sessions knowing I felt like I've always accomplished something, even if it's my 20th round of Gwent in a row.
Something that is so enthralling is the writing, and cinematography. While, yes, the cutscenes of conversations are like any other, the writing is constantly interesting and while I do skip a bit, I more than regularly get caught up in the day-to-day of the Bloody Baron's family life, or Triss' escape from Novigrad.
It's combat can be summed up as a Dark Soul-esque gameplay. That's it. It's simple, albeit a bit clunky but it's always satisfying seeing the limbs of my enemies flying. The level progression is enjoyable, and provides some very beneficial if not a bit overpowered perks and really provides some satisfaction once completing a long story arc.
Something's I absolutely despise is the customisation. Limited, although varied styles of haircuts and beards, all the designs of clothes are absolutely horrific, bar some of the doublet's that don't serve as any real-world use. Otherwise, I've tried to keep with the default armour which I've been able to upgrade once in Novigrad, but never again. I wish there was better designs, if not just continually upgrading the existing default armour in replacing the ones I find. Although, I have not put too much effort in finding other Witcher armours, so I may be surprised in the future.
The menu's, while simple can sometimes be clunky. When I mean to go into the Pause Menu to check out my Gwent cards, I often end up in my Gameplay Menu. I wish there was an easier way to move between them, although that's just nitpicking.
Do I recommend this to people, absolutely. I would suggest watching Netflix's The Witcher first to get a full view of what to expect, as The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt plays very well off the story you see in the show.",,NoxBishop,,,

,2020-01-15,FALSE,,,,149.2,922,5,292030,752,TRUE,"The Witcher 3 is the last game in the Witcher series, and is the largest and grandest by far. Fans of 1 and 2 will immediately be drawn into 3, and players new to the series have, if they want, a reasonable first game to play. The story is self contained, and although it contains heavy references to previous games, and is definitely best enjoyed by playing the previous two first, it stands along if the player wants to enjoy it that way.
At its core, the game is the same as the previous games: The player is Geralt of Rivia, an alchemy powered monster hunter, a Witcher, who adventures through the world getting tangled up in anything and everything in his way, including politics and the occasional world ending crisis. This time the game is presented in full open world format, compared to 1 and 2's location based exploration. The regions are a joy to ride around and explore, and are full of nooks, crannies, and points of interest and sidequests to find as you do. Much of this is unmarked on the map, so you're rewarded for straying off the path and looking for new things. There's tons of sidequests to do, an points of interest to find, so if you're a completionist, you can easily expect to get over a hundred to two hundred hours of content out of the game and expansions, depending on how quickly you play and how completionist you want to be about it.
The game is aesthetically beautiful to look at, and in emotional cutscenes, the animation work is superb, capturing complex facial expressions and stances in close up views without feeling at all ike uncanny valley. The music is understated for the most part as you wander around, with specific moments recieving accompanying tracks. Combat music did get  a little repetitive as I wandered around at times. Skellige especially is wonderful to roam around, and the music there in comparison to Novigrad and Velen is relaxing and immersive.
The game's story centers on the hunt for Geralt's adopted daughter, Ciri, and her connection to the Wild Hunt. Players of the previous games will recognize the Wild Hunt, and a great deal of expansion is done on it in game 3 - things that are simply not mentioned and possibly weren't conceived of yet in previous games, so don't worry about feeling like you may have missed something. Other plot markers involve the continuance of the Northern Wars plot from 2, along with the misadventures of Geralt's friends, Dandelion, Zoltan, Triss, and more. The game's main plot is alright - the Wild Hunt was C-plot at best in 1 and 2, so seeing it take A-plot status in 3, pushing the interesting intrigue and politics to a back seat, was disappointing for me, as that's really why I liked 1 and 2.
The gameplay loop is mostly unchanged from previous games. The alchemy, potion, and bomb making mechanics, as well as toxicity, are unchanged for the most part. You'll find new recipes, mix them up, and replenish them with alcohol on meditation. Potions take up a toxicity meter which governs how many you can drink at once. Decoctions are much longer lasting potions that take up toxicity for long periods of time, but do unique effects based on the monster parts that made them. Potions have been reduced in duration even more from 2, which was already less than 1 - potions are now shorter term combat buffs even more than witcher 2. I used a mod that made them lengthier again. I preferred this style from Witcher 1. Melee combat is fast attacks and strong attacks, as well as parries and ripostes and various buffs and level up skills will affect them, and make them do more damage, higher critical hits, or on hit effects. Signs are useful on a utility level - not so much on a damage level. Lighting things on fire, knocking them over, slowing them down, these are the effects you'll use signs for, not the damage. Both the expansions improve signs a great deal for high level play.
The level up system allows you to choose new skills in alchemy, combat, and sign trees, as well as general perks that do miscellaneous untyped buffs. These trees can be paired alongside mutagens, which give greater bonuses if you match the tree they can from - combat mutagens with combat skills, sign mutagens with sign skills, etc. Levelling up is slow at first, but by mid and late game plot the game is throwing XP at you hand over fist, and you'll level up very quickly. You'll likely end the main campaign at about level 35, and Places of Power will also give you skill points.
If I had cons, it's as follows: I made the mistake of playing in Normal mode, which makes the game incredibly easy later on as you get better gear. I should have played Death March to keep the game a challenge all the way through. The combat system is engaging but nothing incredibly deep. Mostly you can spam light attacks and Quen to great effect. Bombs aren't overly useful for damage, but are good for status effects. Same for most signs. Another frustration for me was falling damage - it's very very high and geralt can't fall very far without instantly dying. I think I died more to fall damage than anything. The enemy assortment in the main non DLC game is not very much. Dogs, ghouls, werewolves/lesser vamps (they fight basically identically) wraiths, and flying wyvern-type creatures form 95% of your encounters, and most monster contracts are just a juiced version of a basic enemy. Human enemies all fight identically regardless of faction or style.
The cons are minor and don't detract from the game at all. Overall, anyone with even a passing interest in the series, any fan of open world RPGs, or anyone looking for a big meaty game to sink a lot of time into, would do very well to pick it up. It won't steer you wrong.",,[LUE] TormakSaber,,,

The secondary quests gave me unique experiences, and I give it my best criticism.  The capabilities' of the game developers in story telling is excellent.  I was immerse in playing the secondary quests far beyond being goal oriented.  The main story is goal oriented, but that alone makes it the most important part of the game.  Compared to the secondary quest the main quest has the best story line.  Yet the secondary quests made me lose track of time, and I had no mindset of goals.  I simple played the game when it came to the secondary quest, and that is what allowed me to become immerse into the game.  When I play the main story I want to stop playing the game, and I want to go to the book store to buy a Witcher novel.
The open world on the other hand is very quite little.  I have no desire to experience it, and the only reason I go exploring is to gather herbs.  The question marks on the map makes me go into the wilderness only to find anticlimactic materials.  The open world is object oriented, and it is not exploring.  I feel like I have to complete objectives rather than experience an artificial world.  With this game I don't want to explore the open world.  I know that my range is limited in the given kingdom in which I'm in.  The open world has a limit to immersion.  The times I am immerse in the open world I meet enemies that are 12 levels higher than Geralt.  This puts the game play at a disadvantage since it becomes statistically impossible to defeat the enemies, yet Geralt should be able to defeat every enemy in the game regardless of his level.  Since he is a unique character to the story.
The relics are extremely easy to find, but I wish they would appear less frequently.  I want to have more options to crafting, and I want more flexibility into magic points.  I don't want to spend more than 16 points to get to the fourth level of magic.  I would rather spend five on the second level and five on the third to get to the fourth level of magic.",,DancesWithMudcrabs,,,

,2020-01-15,FALSE,,,,121,923,4,292030,51,TRUE,"This game is way more fun to read and watch than it is to play.
Actually participating in the locomotion or combat tends to be an exercise in patience. I found myself constantly fighting with the controls in order to accomplish really basic things like ""not falling off a ledge when trying to pick up an item."" Combat is floaty and unrewarding at it's bare level. This game demands that you prepare for encounters like a Monster Hunter game while also presenting combat as the tense, methodical combat of Dark Souls, where you need to pay attention to enemy movements to avoid immediate death. These ends of the game seem to completely undermine one another. Tense fights aren't very tense when you can just throw a couple items with the same name as your enemy to make it 10x easier to kill and preparing isn't very engaging because it's just throwing an item and moving on to normal combat. It's not terrible, but it's enough to prevent me from doing another playthrough.
However, almost every other thing this game has is really really good. The story evolves gradually in a way that lets you get invested without feeling like you're being forced to care about characters in situations that don't really matter. Picking up a main or side quest actually feels engaging because of the performances that contextualize it. Almost all of the quests in this game is either a fetch quest or a quest where you go in a cave and kill the monsters. Normally, this would get stale but the characters asking you to do this are interesting and convincing enough to keep you thoroughly motivated. Yeah, the actual quests themselves are not particularly fun or engaging but I did every single side quest because of I wanted to know more about this character or the world they live in. Worldbuilding is also excellent, throwing you into an interesting bit Polish fiction that feel very distinctive, even if it shares a lot with traditional European fantasy settings.
This game is worth picking up if you are willing to experience a great story in spite of the fairly mediocre game that it's attached to.",,A Sentient Toyota Camry,,,

Even tho I was sceptic I decided to give it a try.Back then I have not known anything about the Witcher series, the storyline, the background, the lore itself. All I knew were the very raw basics of the game: a fantasy middle aged world with monsters and a monster slayer as a main character, excellent graphics and convenient gameplay mechanics.
After the first 10 minutes of gameplay I instantly came to realize It's much more then some good looking monsterslaying... I got immediatly sucked in to (and I cant highlight this enough) the strong story and plot the game was all about.
I really tried my best to finish the story asap because I was so keen on knowing what will happen next in the game. It really felt like like wathcing a movie or reading a good novel apart from a HUGE difference. In this case I was the one deciding what will happen next. It was too late when I realized that not only main characters but whole communities' fate was deppendent of my decisions.
And in my case this was the main feature of the game that made me so obsessed with it.
Ofc in the first playthrough I made all the ''bad'' decisions and after finishing the main story I felt heartbroken and empty. It really got to me. I decided to start exploring the whole World behind the Witcher. Got a better view and image about the characters, the background and the history that made up the Witcher 3.
You can imagine how it felt to sit down again and restard the game from the beginning and playing it through slowly and precisely, keeping attention to every little detail.
It was AMAZING, one of the best decisions of my life, I got the best ending possible, even played through all the DLC's (which represent and entirely new game experience) and finally felt completed.
Long story short... I can only HIGHLY recommend playing this epic, once in a lifetime giant RPG. I promise you will not regret any second or cent spent on it.",7.65612E+16,Scotty,,,

Quests are numerous and expansive, sometimes being short and sweet, or being long and adventure filled. The Story is long, long and filled with fun quests and actions to take on. Monsters are scary (at first), but quickly become something to conquer and nothing but. The Game isn't hard if you're on normal, so it's fun for non-expert gamers.

Then when the talking was over, I went and I killed stuff. I never used Quen in my playthrough, because I'm alpha as [REDACTED]. I also did not craft any potions that were not essential to the quest. I would recommend playing on Blood and Broken Bones or Death March. The other difficulties were not challenging at all. I used gourmet and face-tanked the whole game. So I guess it was my fault for playing on a low difficulty.
The world itself is 10/10. People look like people and not programmed bots. The open-world is beautiful. The weather effects are the best I've ever seen. There were countless moments were I just stopped to admire the view. The music also helped bring the world to life.
I found myself yearning to explore every corner of the world. However, it didn't feel natural to stop during the main quest. Because why would I go boating in Skellige? No, I wanted to save Ciri. But after the main quest it felt almost pointless and un-rewarding.
If you want a good story, play the game and follow the main quest. If you want to feel like a monster hunter in a world filled with evil, avoid the story. I would say the game doesn't do a good job allowing both.
Overall 9/10. Great game, just wish I didn't feel so alone and bored after I finished the story.",,Aden,,,

Clearly the best winner of the trilogy and totally deserved the GOTY of it's releasing year.
Story: The cast of the Witcher III has grown greatly since Witcher II and man was it a good call. Even the smallest characters still caught my interest and I couldn't help but pay attention to everything they said since they all had something interesting to say. It is hard to think about the main story over the many (and I mean MANY) other tales in this release. The monster hunting aspect of Witcher that I loved so has been expanded with these contracts that you collect on these boards that hold flyers. Not every beast you run into needs to die, sometimes you must decide if that is truly necessary but watch out! Some are going to try to trick you.
The main story is another chase for a person you are looking for except this time around it's someone very close to our hero and this is the most personal quest in the books for him. Along the way you will meet colourful characters that will lead the way but of course in the Witcher world nothing happens for free, so the majority of the story is doing favors so you can get info on where you must look for your important person. Luckily none of these stories are anywhere near bland.

Combat: The combat of this game doesn't change too much from it's predecessor except for minor improvements that make the combat feel better and the Witcher signs all work a bit different.
Misc: Lot's more loot this time around. More armour, more swords, and ways to customize each a bit.
GWENT. boy oh BOY do I love Gwent. I usually hate card games for their complexity but Gwent is your friend. Easy to learn and also easy to master (against NPC's atleast). If you get into Gwent you will be spending hours fighting every merchant and friend you find so you can get that one more card into your deck.

Side quests are actually interesting, with choices having lingering affects that you may encounter later on in your playthrough. The main story is compelling enough, and your choices matter there, too.
The combat can be a bit clunky, but once you get a handle on it and on player character movement it isn't too bad.
The DLC is certainly worth the money if you enjoyed the base game and want to see more of your favorite characters, with new and interesting ones on top.

,2020-01-13,FALSE,,,,75.1,975,7,292030,153,TRUE,"I enjoy the game, mostly for its story telling and world building. But generally it's pretty decent. I will say for those getting into the game or looking to see whether it's for them. Think a slightly janky watered down dark souls combat (lots of rolling or sidestepping, except the jankiness comes in the form of you may dodge towards an enemy instead of the direction you pressed, that type of jankiness, like they didn't finish beta testing and polishing the combat controls).
Outside of the combat jankiness it's a fantastic game, there's a couple tweaks that could be done, less monsters that constantly heal to max in battle, less constant armor/weapon repairing would be nice, or let me repair it myself a little easier. (admittedly only 15 hours into the game, but so far no easy/inexpensive way to fix gear). Story telling is fantastic, it feels like a living breathing world with a unique culture, it's like a prebuilt character version of morrowinds feel to be honest.
I have a personal gripe about levels making it so that versus certain enemies I literally cannot win versus them no matter how good you are. Like for example a werewolf, you can outplay for a literal eternity, however if you're low level enough you don't do much damage which you'd think would be fine except werewolves can heal to full unless you bring moon dust (a relatively difficult thing to procure the ingredients and make multiple of, so you're gonna run out before you kill the werewolf.
For those of you like myself who hate tutorials, please hold with it, grit your teeth and ignore being talked down to and pandered to for 15 minutes straight. It's a fantastic game once you finish the tutorials and the castle area it gets so much more fun.
Mainly outside of those minor critiques it's a fantastic game built around story telling, world building, magic and it's place in the world and playing a monster hunter.",,Jekel8888,,,

It's cases such as TW3 that I really wish Steam offered a ""neutral"" option instead of the binary Recommended/Not Recommended system.
I‚Äôm rarely the type that lets popular appreciation for certain piece of media affect how excited I am for said form of entertainment; however, I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt go into TW3 with high hopes. I‚Äôve heard/read from multiple forums and sources, both popular and underground, that TW3 was EASILY the best RPG of all time, and even several claims that it was easily the best game of ALL TIME. So, I GUESS you could say TW3 had some standards to hold up to.
TW3's ""setup"" for the whole game spans well over an hour, but over that time I had that gut feel that I wasn't really going to enjoy it. It was over the 2-hour mark that I truly had a deeper understanding of a game and understood that I was already going to get burnt out over the type of game it was (having played both W1 and W2). As I had already played through the intro and could no longer refund the game, I stubbornly decided to play throughout the entire game (I guess I should state that I've always been extremely stubborn/determined/hellbent, especially when it comes to my hobbies, almost to the point where describing it as ""masochistic"" wouldn't really be a mis-definition. Doesn‚Äôt really help that I try to be as frugal as possible so you best believe I wanted to get my money‚Äôs worth) as there was pretty much no turning back the clock and refunding (I also got the GOTY edition so I have the DLC to look forward to).
Over the course of almost half a year, I trudged through the game. I didn‚Äôt really ENJOY the experience per say, merely tolerated it. My main gripes with the game were the following: the gameplay/combat, the quests+side quests, the characters, and the story, with the main culprit being the gameplay.
TW3‚Äôs gameplay has barely evolved from the system put in place by TW1, a game with dated combat even by 2008 standards. Witcher 3‚Äôs combat requires no thought, is extremely basic, requiring literally maybe like 3 inputs (5 MAX if running CONSTANT bombs+signs), and absolutely tedious as it barely changes for the entire god forsaken game (maybe a special combat/spell action). Even playing on Death March (the game‚Äôs hardest difficulty, branded as ‚Äúinsane‚Ä?and only for the ‚Äúmost hardcore gamers‚Ä?, the only time I died was employing stupid self-challenges on myself in order to spice up the combat (how late can I dodge/parry without taking damage?  How many hits can I deal before getting hit? Etc etc.). As the main quality I value in a game is the enjoyment of gameplay, I couldn‚Äôt enjoy almost a single thing about the gameplay TW3 has to offer (also the final ending sequence with ramp-up and conclusion included was so thrill-absent I swear my heartrate didn‚Äôt even exceed like 70 bpm but what can I expect from this games combat like honestly).
For damage calculating, the level scaling is absolutely dog sh!t. If enemies are 2-3 levels over you, it‚Äôs not the end of the world as they can just as easily be dispatched with the addition of 1 or 2 extra hits. However, as SOON as enemies are like 4 levels above you, the enemies take literally like 15% of your normal damage and their damage is amplified like 3x, 2 or even 1 shotting you. Fall damage is also extremely stupid. Falling like 14 feet results in a safety roll taking no damage, fall 15 feet and you break both your legs leaving you at 10% HP, fall 16 feet and it‚Äôs an instagib. Disabling the ‚ÄúEnemy Scaling‚Ä?option in the settings menu (that I was unfortunately made aware of only over half way into the game) made it so every enemy I faced (including RATS and DOGS) wouldn‚Äôt tank like 5 hits, so that‚Äôs a plus.
So, onto the side quests. I kid you not, pretty much 80% of side quests followed this linear formula; 1 ‚Ä?go to said location; 2 ‚Ä?hold RMB and follow trail; 3 ‚Ä?interact with item/enemies. The other 20% were scavenger hunts with the difficulty of a 4-piece puzzle and quests so mundane I can‚Äôt even recall them.
As for the main story, I‚Äôll admit it was slightly interesting. The story telling is pretty good for what it‚Äôs worth. However, the whole ordeal of getting to the GOOD parts of the story telling basically feels like you‚Äôre running around pointlessly doing the most MUNDANE sh!t possible, interacting with characters with very little depth that you know for a FACT won‚Äôt even be mention outside of their questline unless they happen to be a supporting character of value (which only like 15-20 characters are in a sea of like 300 interactions). And as for the main supporting characters that you find yourself surrounded by through the course of the game, almost none really struck a chord with me as they had barely been given the depth of a pothole and were even given aids personalities benevolently given by good ol‚Ä?CDPR.
As a side note, the inventory/storage was so poorly coded that storing any half-decent amount of gear literally lags the game for 2-3 seconds (and even 5 seconds when stockpiling) when moving literally 1 item. I just installed a 9999 weight limit mod to avoid that spaghetti code all together.
So enough of defecating on the game. I‚Äôll be one to admit that what the game does well, it does ASTRONOMICALLY well. The music is amazing, from combat themes (shoutout Silver for Monsters), adventuring themes (shoutout The Fields of Ard Skellig), to tavern music and ambience (Shoutout Back on the Path, Another Round for Everyone, A Story You Won‚Äôt Believe, and even the damn Unreleased Gwent/Tavern Track). The game‚Äôs atmosphere and environment are fantastic, to the heavenly Elven architecture to the slums of Novigrad, from the snowy peaks of Ard Skellig to the dark, DANK caves in Velen. The lore is very deep and ingrained in the world (creds to Andrzej Sapkowski) and feels so natural you could dive on wikis and forums for hours just reading up on it. Gwent, a mini-card game so unimportant to the overarching entirety of the entire game that you can completely ignore it, was so interesting and fun. It‚Äôs honestly better than the P2W mainstream trash that is Hearthstone. The gwaficks were also pretty good, but a far cry from being the ‚Äútop 3 prettiest game of all time‚Ä?with mudded textures from 20 feet away, extremely mediocre parallaxing, and flora/fauna ripped straight from a game from 2011. However, even with all these pros, they unfortunately don‚Äôt even hold a candle to the focus of the main game and its flaws.
TL; DR ‚Ä?The Witcher 3‚Äôs abysmal gameplay, repetitive formula-abiding quests, and annoying characters (all these negatives make up like 80% of the game :/) were strongly outclassed by the game's FANTASTIC strong points (Environment, Music, Worldbuilding/Architecture/Lore), resulting in a very interesting and engrossing game that plays like a pile of garbage from the 2000s that's as fun as waiting in the DMV line.

It is absolutely fantastic in every aspect: world setting, visuals, atmosphere, story, narrative, characters, gameplay, performance, replayability - you name it.

The first one's combat really put me off, so I skipped to the second, and was pleasantly surprised. It felt entirely better than the previous one, and the entirety of the content was very entertaining. Immediately became one of my favorite games of all time.
After I finished the second with such appreciation, I really wanted to see how the first one was outside the horrible combat, so I went back and just modded 1-shot kills onto it and then I could at least stand playing through it. Take away the fighting, and the first one felt almost better than the second!
At that point I had extremely high expectations for the third, and was wondering if it could actually be any better....... Lo and behold, they knocked it out of the park with bases loaded!
This game not only took all the great things about the first and second and implemented them perfectly, but it also has everything you wished the first 2 had! Mounting, fast travel, decoction-like consumables, treasure hunting, etc... and on top of all that, they put it into an open world!
I got lucky and was able to purchase the entire trilogy for only $16 over the holiday sales which was already a score, but now that I've played it, I would gladly pay more than quadruple that! I've gotten 100 hours of gameplay from the third one ALONE, and still have PLENTY more to do. Even the first ones had a lot of content... 71 hours played between the 2 of them. This series has easily been the greatest value I have ever purchased.
I can't even recall the few issues I had with the third game as I'm writing this because they are so minor. You can count them with 1 hand.
So to conclude, I highly recommend everyone experience this game if you can!
(The first 2 aren't necessary to play the third at all, but I would recommend it if you want a good long story)
While playing these I discovered that there's also a Witcher series on Netflix that I'm going to watch once I'm done, but this game just set the bar pretty high so I'm going into it with low expectations despite the praise for it.",,RANDEAG,,,

It only took a few hours of gameplay for The Witcher 3 to turn into my newly discovered obsession. I found myself waking up early on weekends to get an early start. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll only finish one quest tonight‚Ä?often extended to two or three, and I starting doing something that I usually never do: replaying quests to try different options. 800 hours later (#noragrets), and I‚Äôm finally ready to put my controller down. What an experience. Never has a single-player game kept me interested for so long, which speaks volumes about how immersive this game truly is. CD Projekt Red set a very high standard for Triple A games and a strong reputation for themselves.
By far my favorite gaming experience of 2019.
Played with Playstation 4 controller
Positive:
For a game that is 4+ years old, the Witcher 3 really looks amazing. From the strands of Geralt‚Äôs hair, to the different landscapes and cities (I especially loved Toussaint), to the weather/lighting, you can really tell that a lot of time was spent to make this game feel as alive as possible. I have never seen a game do the sunspots in your vision as well as this game has managed.
The biggest selling points, in my opinion, are the characters and story telling. Without the magnificent writing and voice acting offered, the Witcher 3 would not have been such an immersive experience. Given how many characters are introduced in the series, it‚Äôs amazing how many unique personalities there are. Literally none of the main characters are repetitive, dull, or lack personality. There are countless quests and wonderful moments that I remember vividly and am very fond of, for example, when I received a drawing from a little girl I saved. More impressively so, you even feel a part of the game while in the overworld. Many NPCs will interact with you as you as you walk by. Depending on the city and progression of the game, they will either call you names, spit at you, or praise and greet you. I especially liked that cats hiss at you (Witchers are mutants of sorts and animals dislike that).
Although this may sound contradictory, it is also great that you are allowed to skip dialogue. This is perfect for those who don‚Äôt care about the story, but in my case it makes replaying quests (to choose different options) a more pleasant experience, since I don‚Äôt have to wait through long cutscenes that I have already seen.
There is SO much content. Even in the base game alone (which took me approximately 75 hours to play through), the world is so vast, full of quests, treasure hunts, contracts, and even fun easter eggs. The Skellege isles alone has over 20 islands that you can explore individually. My favorite discovery by far is when I found dead Tyrion locked up in a cell. To my surprise, I even enjoyed playing Gwent, the card game introduced as a mini-game. Initially I ignored Gwent as a whole, but once I learned how to play it, it quickly became an addiction. I remember spending two full weekends roaming around only to play Gwent and collect new cards. The fact that CD Projekt Red chose to release Gwent as a separate game really goes to show how successful it is.
I absolutely love that the DLCs introduced (Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine) are fully worth their price. Both DLCs add more than 20 hours of gameplay just through the main quest lines alone, but even more if you want to delve deeply into each (highly recommend to do so). I don‚Äôt want to give away too much, but both main quests are spectacularly written. New monsters and quests are introduced, and in the case of Blood and Wine, a whole new area, new upgrades (both to your character and weapons), and the opportunity to have your own villa are added. Not to sound too biased but some of my favorite quests are included in Blood and Wine. It is also a nice touch that the developers included a feature which allows you to start the game directly at the DLC (start at level 30 with average equipment) but honestly I would recommend playing through the main game first, as it will make the DLCs that much more special.
Conclusion:
‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚ò?Exceptional
The Witcher 3 is a hell of an experience that will remain deeply engraved in my memory. I mean there aren‚Äôt many games out there that allow you to have sex on top of a taxidermied unicorn. I also cannot stress enough how much this game offers for a single-player experience - I could easily spend another delightful 30-50 hours on my current save file without replaying quests or starting a new game (+). Highly recommended!
This game is a steal at full price, and even more so when it‚Äôs on sale! What are you waiting for?",,Guts,,,

Games fine, playing on death march difficulty which is still pretty easy. controls have been improved over launch but are still slightly wonky. Having Keybinds for potions that have like a handful of charges but not for oils which need constant changing and reapplication is legit nonsense. The sign system is dumb, needing to select which sign you want to cast by pressing it's key 3-7 or something, and then casting it by pressing Q, instead of just casting the sign by pressing it's button and freeing up Q which is a prime real estate keybind for something more important.
I'm usually ok in FPS situations like fallout or w/e, but aiming this crossbow makes me feel like i have a disability.
Leveling progression is trash. Not specifically in this game, but in general. Half the ? icons i went to were low level and gave reduced XP, half of them where too high level to do at the moment. Why make an open world game where everything is available from the start and then make the enemies too high level so the quest can't be done. Can't wait for leveling systems to just not be in RPGs anymore. Totally limiting system.
Everything else is good, story is good, combat feels fun and if you dodge / roll / attack in the perfect order in a group of mobs you feel fancy as ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Too many side thingies to do, though. i feel compelled to do them all but don't want to because they're getting boring. I literally went from ? to ? and got 4 nekkar(er?) nests in a row. Lame.

The story is amazing, with enough quests and sideplots to keep you occupied for hundreds of hours. if that wasnt enough, the DLC is literally big enough to be a totally separate game, but fits pretty seamlessly into the original. CDPR carefully built upon the successes and failures of witcher 1 and 2 to create a complex yet balanced combat system, but if that doesnt float your boat, switch to story mode, and youll still find weeks of play as you solve the mysteries that build the overarching plot. Didnt play the other games or read the books? no worries! recognizable characters are more like easter eggs to to those in the know, while newcomers get plenty of exposition on who is important and who isnt.
while there are quirks and flaws in the game engine that have become the stuff of memes, such as roach spawning on top of houses etc, they are easy to work around and rarely, if at all, detract from gameplay. frequently, you may just stop and stare at the beauty of a sunset or a storm tearing across the landscape, as the game also features a complex natural weather and time system that serves little purpose other than to deepen the immersion of the player into the environment and storyline.

I first bought this game in 2015. Played the hell out of the game, found the first card game I actually enjoy inside of it, gwent. Was 60 hours deep and went ""this other new game looks fun, I wanna try that.""
Well I came back to it again in 2017, so much time had passed I had forgotten exactly what I was up too and it felt wrong coming back out of nowhere. So I got another save started, got to 60-70 hours deep and got side tracked again.
So now I started my current save, Based on my math Im at the 70ish hour deep mark. I started this save in december of 2019....
They have added two expansions that I still havent touched.
Im level 23.
Im roughly halfway through the game.
Im still covered in quests I need to do with more Ive yet to pick up from bounty boards.
Apparently its not uncommon for people to finish the main story + both DLCs around level 50ish.

The main storyline is pretty generic, however, it is well written, the side quests are engaging and before long you are so engrossed in the story that you are roaming the map, doing the SQ's and doing the witcher contracts, with large amounts of time just roaming the countryside dong all the additional stuff.
The dialogue with the NPC's are incredibly well crafted.   The characters are beautifully fleshed out and you really feel a moral sense in the choices you make - I have often sat a while and just pondered before making decisions.   What you do matter - immediately in the quest and also down the line.
Alliances forged now will matter later in the game.   I am so engrossed in the world and the characters.   The soundtrack is fantastic, the gameplay immersive, beautiful graphics and a free world to roam.   It is a 10/10 for me.   I can definitely recommend this.
I found the game due to the Witcher series on Netflix.   I have no background on the lore and as such the game was a new experience to the franchise for me.

If you've played Dark Souls or any of the recent Assassin's Creed games, then you'll find it to be quite intuitive. The story and plot for literally all quests in the game is top notch. You're rarely ever doing just some fetch quest to get some boring item for some boring character. Everything has depth to it, even the most insignificant seeming quests and characters. You're faced with many choices throughout the game, some have bigger impacts than others. Some you will see the outcome of your choice sooner, some later, much later. But remember every choice matters. Now that, by itself is what separates this from almost every other modern RPG of the last decade.

P.S. Make sure you play the entire game, and do the DLCs. They are worth every penny due to the content they add. Especially for the price you pay.

But if you don't like the gameplay personally, know this. It does NOT get better. Don't stick it out for the story when you could watch it else where.
This game is perfectly fine, and if it was a different kind of game I might even rate it high. However, if you, like me, are interested in this because it's an action RPG with elements of progressive rpgs like TES or Fable, be warned this isn't what you're looking for.
You need to be prepared to be Geralt the Witcher, more than just a Witcher or a fighter in this world. Geralt has a very specific style of fighting based around using a two handed weapon and using small spells as a backup. You can, if you can stand the combat long enough expand your arsenal, but for the first 50 or so hours you might only be choosing between light or heavy armor as far as real customization.
I would have enjoyed the story if the gameplay didn't drag me down and make it a slog to play. That's not to say it's bad gameplay, only that it's not for everyone and not enough people talk about that. So I give you my warning that if you don't like the experience of the first few hours of game play; do not ""stick it out"" and lose your refund window like I did. If you don't like the gameplay, be aware that it does not get better any time soon.",,Fortello,,,

It is simply a 9.5/10 MINIMUM video game, and for me is close to, if not, game of the century. This is the type of game where you beat it, want infinitely more, and wonder what to do next with a hole in your belly. Although I wish you would just play it for your own sake, I will go into cons and then pros.
CONS (nitpicks)
-combat can be a LITTLE wonky sometimes, and honestly may turn some off (honestly feels ok for a 2015 game)
-typical 2015 game issues including some wonky movement by your character and characters in the background of conversations
-story starts off a little slow for some myself included
-backstory is needed to get full enjoyment out of all the characters that you meet (your playable character Geralt knows returning characters, newer players may be lost about who they are = easy google search about the character or even full summaries about the last 2 games)
-conversation options dont always exactly match what Geralt say, but is more accurate to what you pick then a game like Fallout 4 that is a big offender of this
-infinite waifu wars about the two main women you can pick
PROS
-unforgettable and different story
-unforgettable characters
-beautiful looking settings (multiple open worlds with many intriguing points of interest)
-plot that gets you personally involved from your choices, featuring multiple endings that change with your choices
-2 DLC packs that are actually WORTH their PRICE woah. both packs include new questlines that are better than standalone GAMES
-grim as ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• tone and setting, extremely dark plot points
-the SOUNDTRACK is so different and amazing, look up Witcher soundtrack right now and tell me it doesnt set a precedent for the game
-rewarding combat that rewards you heavily for preparing for a fight
-gear progression flows well and rewards exploring for diagrams of craftable weapons or powerful weapons themselves
-multiple difficulties that are clear in what you should expect
-infinity things to do including fistfighting for money, horeraces, hunting some pretty cool monsters and etc.
-character customization (change geralts hairstyle/beard style, and armor which can be dyed)
-GWENT: a charming mix of poker and maybe magic the gathering? extremely fun mini game nonetheless (they made a standalone game specifically for this because of how popular in the main game it was)
-conclusion at the end of the last DLC that warms your heart and makes you happy for your character (unless you get the bad ending)
if youve read this far wow good job please do yourself and buy this game, this game is worth the pricetag for GOTY edition in my honest opinion. it won GOTY in 2015, got a decent Netflix adaptation, and is praised by many to be one of if not the best game of all time for a reason, I implore you, please buy this game",7.65612E+16,papa murphy,,,

That said, there are some issues, during my 25 hours, I encountered several bug and glitches, though they were simple graphical problems at best and occassionally caused my character to behave as if indoors at worst. The only egregious errors I know of are a rare crash during the Griffin boss fight at the beginning of the game and another crash when diving for treasure in a certain location with a Radeon 5700 XT graphics card (which, to my knowledge, has yet to be solved). When the game does work, however, it works beautifully. To quote ""The Art of War"" by Sun Tzu, ""Know your enemy and know yourself, and you shall always prevail."" Gameplay in Witcher 3 very much revolves around this philosophy, to the point where I'm willing to make an argument that you spend more time preparing for certain fights than you do actually fighting said fights. Witcher 3 gets my full recommendation. A perfect 10.",7.65612E+16,ThexLoneWolf,,,

Seamless, immersive story-playing.

I found the world interesting, but the gameplay was aged and clunky (uninteresting combat, and simple things like climbing up/down ledges felt like an old Resident Evil game). Some friends convinced me W3 was better, so I picked it up. I'm currently 30+ hours into it, and the game has me hooked. Gameplay is fluid. The world is immersive. Story is interesting. The game also has great options for turning on/off UI features, so you can have as much or as little ""help"" from the game as you want (e.g., turn off pathing and quest markers, or turn off the minimap entirely, and you can show or hide enemy health bars).

Well the netflix version and the wild hunt are basically tad bit similar,both being searching for ciri or geralt one way or another.
I am writing the review as of januray 2020 yet this game looks stunning even after 5 years,i am using gtx 1660 and it gives me stable 60 fps on ultra settings,the game is well optimized,it has few minor bugs though but it shouldn't be a problematic one..
CD PROJEKT RED completed revamped the third title of the game, while the other two had their own tales to tell,However its a bit different than the previous version,e.g you had to brew potions of your own, Could meditate only on specific places which this game has done away with it , also not to mention the infamous jump which you couldn't do back in those games. Just like the developers had done it,you can continue the story of the previous 2 games based on the decisions you made.. Spoiler (Letho)
Overall:i would recommend anyone who has yet to play the game, do purchase it, its cheaper on sale if you want so.

Now where do I start I've played this game over 6 (over the course of many account cause as I'm lazy to switch to another) times and I'm still not satisfied completing it cause OMG THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS TO DO. This game is absolutly it's got one beautiful graphics, absolulty moving songs for battle, long travels (cause Fast Travel is for boring people) good character build up, and many more things. This game can also be very addictive. I have literally forgotten about my friends & work cause of this game cause I showed up after 5 days and kept saying winds howling and now that the Witcher series is out I'm dishing out ""hmm"" & ""‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•"" along with that. The fun thing about this game is that it always keeps you working either through making potions searching for places with power or random creature attacks or someone asking for help in the middle of the road, so there's never a dull moment. The main story of the game is well written & executed in my opinion. I have not played the orignal first two games but I've followed up with their stories. The romantic choices are actually pretty intense as long as you don't skip dialogs it really makes you crack your head as to whom to choose. Never go both, just don't (greedy pigs) The fighting mechanics are fun especially when you learn to combo the spells with your moves and fighting style I've not used parry a lot at all I just dodge the npc attacks. Also the game is quiet dull about killing specific enemies like noon wraiths so read the beastiary before making moves on a enemy you have to prepare for any encounters you can't just go dancing into the battle filed thinking you'll wisk this off Prince of Persia or Assassins Creed style, NO! you have to do the hard work of preparing. Now the DLC's they are amazing I've just recently bought them and they are good. Especially blood and wine I enjoyed that a lot as there are new enemies and more new things to explore. I haven't completed either DLC properly as I've not gotten to opportunity to play them more than once but they are worth every penny & they add a new experience to the game overall with new upgrades and so on. I haven't spoken about Gwent much nor will I cause Gwent is not for everybody especially those who only played UNO. I never understood the game in the beginning but thanks to youtube Tutorials I picked up on it quickly. I won't say much about Gwent as thats a totally exclusive topic to talk about and you know why, as it's so much fun once you understand it. Overall fantastic game I wish there was multi player co-op mod to do quests and some quest are really hard and you could always use a helping hand on those. Like killing dragons is really difficult compared to a griffin. I wish there was a way to store things in chests that were univesably access able. Like the ender chests in minecraft would save me a lot of time instead of selling my items. That all I got folks If you like it leave a comment must've definatly missed a lot of stuff as you could really type a lot about this game any quirky comments with a dask of sarcasm are always welcome.

Pros:
+ Good graphics
+ Riding around on you horse in the big world feels great a few hours
+ Good voice acting
Cons:
- No mechanical depth to combat, most systems can be ignored, just dodge and hit them on the head
- Crafting system is absurd (for example you combine leather straps into a full piece of leather, should be other way around...)
- GUI is primarily for console so it feels like Skyrim, playing a bad port of a console game
- Leveled loot is boring. You switch gear almost every level which means you never get attached to your gear (also absurd that a better sword should be harder to use...)
- The game world itself is boring, if want to take a walk in the fields i can just go out my RL door.

I felt bad about spending money on the game, and was looking for any excuse to return it. I think what my dumb lizard brain settled on is that I shouldn't play this game without playing the previous one. So, refund. A year or 2 later, I watched the Netflix show, and decided to give it another shot. I bought all 3 games for $20 combined. I thought the dated combat of the first one would be a turn off, but I actually really enjoyed myself. I beat the game in a few days and moved on to the second. It was a massive improvement immediately, graphically and gameplay, though it felt a bit short. Then I started this game, and, just, wow. Everything felt so smooth, the combat feels great, the options, especially armor and weapon selection was incredible, and I finally got my very own Roach, instead of a Roche.  While the gameplay was impressive, what has really blown me away is the story telling. The world just feels so real! It's alive, and responsive, and unlike games like Skyrim (which I still love, don't @ me) it feels like the world exists outside of Geralts story, even though he finds himself in the middle of quite a bit. All of the quests are so well written, even completely missable side quests.

The only ones who complain about the combat are ones that are like ""BUT THIS AINT MEH DARK SOULS COMBAT.""
My only personal negative thing about the game is that you can't upgrade or stay with the default armor of Geralt. It is my personal favorite out of all the gears, but this downside is more of a preference.
With all the content it has, this game is an example of what a game should be, not some cash grab from a lot of you know,,,,, controversial companies.

Barely even touched the games massive story! Its amazing from just slaying monsters to crafting potions, oils, gear, etc. Normal is however a lot easier than expected, overly the top easy, if anything I'd try a harder difficulty, haven't tried anything past normal, but from what I've heard death march is a challenging playthrough that takes advantage of crafting. In death March, your potions and oils play an vital role and it is highly recommended that yall do craft and explore to find the diagrams! The game is absolutely immersive and just draws you in! The only downsides in my opinion is some of the dialogue and cut scenes are really awkward, not awkward, but certainly off, the 2nd thing is the game looks astonishing, but in certain cutscenes for example in the beginning you're required to inspect a dead man where his limbs are torn apart and what not, and there some of the looks of the body seem really poor compared to the rest of the game, that being said its by no means a turn off or game breaking thing, and lastly the third thing is just the game itself. Its written beautifully, and the game is fun to play, and always draws you in and in my opinion is the worse part. It sucks you in and all you wanna do is play, but school or work comes in and its on the back of your mind always. Ill be sitting there and ill be like damn do I wanna go home and play the Witcher. The game is fantastically one of the best looking games I've ever seen even when the game came out in 2015. Its a must play for anyone that loves open world games! Please comment down below of whats your favorite mechanic of the game! Mine personally is the vast crafting system and just how fluent the combat is, dodge left, dodge right. Yell oh ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and roll hoping you don't die and just coming back to cut the monster or human in half is always satisfying!

Cant say how many times I tried switching slots and using the wrong item.
Now we come to the god awful tracking in its ""locked"" mode, in this game they kinda tried the darksouls lock but at the same time you ""lock"" onto something that jumps around a bit youll basically have to track it with the right stick manually anyways. Oh youre in combat with more than one thing? Good luck locking onto what you want.
Yes you can rebind stuff on keyboard but even when I remapped things it just made the combat even more choppy. The combat in this game was always either mind numbing spam light on a creature x levels below you, or you have to  cheese the living hell out of the system hoping that the armor on hit and endless food will outlast something 3 levels above you.
For someone thats been a huge fan of titles like Dark souls, MHW, Divinity, ESO, BDO, and even the Witcher show I had high hopes coming into it but either I need another 20 hours to get to ""The good stuff"" or there really is nothing here besides the story cause holy ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• is the combat awkward with plenty of superarmored NPC attacks that makes for a hit once or twice and dodge playstyle or facetank with shield and food.

The main storyline was absolutely incredible and it actually made me love the main characters and even some of the side characters as well (Dandelion/Jaskier for example). I spent a lot of time trying to make the right choices with each of the characters you encounter trying to get the best outcome. Of course this doesn't always work out, and the game often makes you regret your decisions or feel incredibly good about yourself when you do the right thing. The DLC's are absolutely incredible as well, and almost even be considered to be their standalone game in my opinion. This game is the reason I started watching the Witcher show on Netflix as well.

It's as close to perfect as a game of its type can be given the current state of the medium (i.e., what the gaming community thinks it wants from games and what the limitations are for providing truly interactive storytelling, both technologically and imaginatively). That having been said, it's important to remember that however close to perfect ""The Witcher 3"" may be it isn't quite flawless. However, just as in the cases of carpentry and sculpture, how the work incorporates flaws or limitations often helps define the work as 'master' rather than 'mediocre'.
It's important to bear in mind that however gripping the story, however well-drawn the characters, however real (for all the beauty and ugliness contained in that term) the relationships between those characters, however utterly well-rendered and realized the world, however tense the action makes us feel... this game is still more glorified walking simulator than anything else. The world is gorgeous. Huge. Utterly immersive. But it doesn't require the player to do a lot of navigating or path finding, such as ""Death Stranding"" is said to require. There is combat in the game but even on the most difficult setting (""Death March""), it's nowhere near Souls-like in challenge. Yes, there are puzzles; no, those puzzles do not test your problem solving abilities the way ""Myst"" or ""Portal"" will.
You know what, though? That's fine: ""The Witcher 3"" isn't trying to be any of those games. Not even a little bit. It knows what it is (a tale), what it wants to do (share that tale with you) and what it expects of the player (help tell the tale). As Sapkowski himself wrote, ""A tale is a tale. And has its own rules."" Understand that. Accept that. Then take the ride... and be swept away.
Re: Difficulty, or The Sweet Spot Between Fun And Frustrating
This game really wants to be played on 1 of 2 difficulties: the lowest or the highest. You're best served either taking the journey through a glorified walking simulator (i.e., ""Just The Story"" difficulty)... OR if you want something that will resemble a challenge at the outset (during the calibration period where you're learning the games systems and refining your execution of said systems), ""Death March"" is where you want to be.
If game play matters to you, take the option that's most impacted by difficulty. Honestly, there's not much in the way of meaningful difference in challenge between ""Blood And Broken Bones"" and ""Death March."" I played my first ~15 hours on ""Blood And Broken Bones"" and asked myself, ""Is that it? Really?"" Played the rest on ""Death March"" and never looked back. Yes, it can be challenging. Yes, you'll lose/die at times. But ""Death March"" isn't truly difficult. It will certainly require that you learn the systems, pay attention and exercise patience. It is absolutely NOT insurmountable... even if you're not experienced with or particularly capable at third-person action games.
Walk The Path. Choose ""Death March."" Worst case, you can always change the difficulty later on. This is definitely one of those situations where growing pains in the early hours of the game will help you reap tremendous benefits at the end.
10/10, two thumbs up. If you enjoy RPGs, dark fantasy, mature themes, choices, and consequences, ""The Witcher 3"" is simply not to be missed. It is for fantasy RPGs what ""Half-Life 2"" is for FPSs: a once-in-a-generation experience.

The story and RPG elements of the game are amazing i've been hooked from the start in every playthrough so far. Theres a few minor bugs but nothing major to complain about. Gwent is also highly addictive and adds plenty of hours to your playtime searching for all the cards and players in the world. Difficulty wise if you're an experienced RPG player you should probably play on Death March as after a while  the difficulty ingame shakes off once you've crafted the essentials and gotten use to the combat system.
The game looks amazing in higher graphical settings paired with the mod - ""The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project"" - which is simple to install and makes everything look even better than originally.
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is simply amazing value for money at ¬£34.99 but in most steam sales you'll be able to pick it up for ¬£10-20 usually which is a real bargain, The base game content alone will give you 100+ Hours of playtime before adding two amazing DLC in the form of the Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine expansions - Both of which add new systems to the game that add some more RPG elements to the game and further ways to customise the way you play.
Overall If you're a lover of RPG games or games with a deep story then the Witcher 3:Wild Hunt is a game that you wont regret buying.

I played this game not having played another Witcher game, and I'll say it was a bit of an adjustment for me, given my expectations, which at the time were basically for it to be a darker more serious Skyrim. Having played it, I was very wrong about that, but it still delivers very well on the story, gameplay, and graphics. After getting used to the difficulty, having not played games of this style before, I loved it. It's easily one of my favorite games of all time. If you take your time and explore all the nooks and crannies, the game can easily take 70+ hours on your first low-difficulty playthrough. Additionally thanks to it's length, if you go back to play it again, you will find the story to be easily replayable, and with three different endings to the main story, you'll have plenty on your to-do list for hundreds of hours. All that would be worthless, however, without great characters and a great story, which it delvers on as well. Also, the DLC storylines ""Hearts of Stone"" and ""Blood and Wine"" are amazing too. And while the former of the two is not as good as the latter, both are definitely worth picking up. And if all that wasn't enough for you, there's a game within the game: Gwent. Playing Gwent and amassing your collection of cards is an unexpected pleasure I find in this game. And while sometimes it may spoil the tone of the story (e.g. a man just gets done telling Geralt his son was violently murdered and Geralt suggests a round of Gwent), it can sometimes lighten the mood, and then the following game of cards adds another layer of challenge and fun to the game.
Additionally, the recent Netflix series puts this game back in the spotlight, but I will caution that if you aren't versed in the lore of the Witcher and you want a spoiler-free show experience, then while I think you're still missing out on a very good game, I'll say you may want to hold off on this game. Otherwise, definitely pick up this game, it is one of the best ever made.",,Thermobyte,,,

Got kicked in his chest

1 Intro
2 Pro and praise
-Truly an RPG, you are a witcher and its a broad specter you live out this role.
-Wide range of emotions you will experience in this product.
-The camera during cut-scenes, it dramatizes an other dull moment of stationary camera cut-scene.
-Leveling system is not grindy! Lvl 1-10 requires 1000xp, lvl 10-20, 1500xp, its adds only 500 extra xp per ten level. I highly appreciate this because ""65 mil xp till next level"" makes you lose the connection to it being special.
-Most fights have meaning!
3 Con and Functions i miss
-Some oil bottles you put on your swords are similar to one another; five of them have orange in them in different hues; one mixes them up easily. Symbols or some other way to distinguish them would of been wanted.
4 Comments
-Multiple references to old stories, ex: little red riding hood and snow white and the seven dwarfs, or is it just me?
-How this game portrayed different races felt like a mix of racism but also a description of different personalities, this mixed or back and forth. For some reason this personalities part felt new to me, anyone else?

It's such a well done game, and the signs of life in recent expansion packs is another promising feature for the future. You can tell, when visiting towns, how much effort was put in to the game, including things that are easy to take for granted such as the side card game (now a standalone app), NPC characters with life, and a bustling world with a variety of quest types. There is so much story in this game that it's one you can comfortably play for hours and still feel like a small part of an immense world. However, I'm a bit taken back by the violence in this game, and I'd like to see a way to step back the gore more in any future releases by allowing players to turn it off. Unlike Breath of the Wild, this isn't a game I'd recommend to my animal loving and vegetarian wife, or children, and that's important as we approach a new decade, where relationships are more equal as more people adopt digital games and entertainment beyond just the standard gaming nerd. I get the realism intended with violence in a war-torn area, and the story redeems itself with solid world-building and moral compass points, but still - I reach for The Witcher series as an alternative to the Game of Thrones violence that's unnecessary to perpetuate to tell a great story. Please give us a Witcher 4, and keep up the good work. I've got hours ahead of me - and that is uniquely special for a game that is many years old.",,Rynocat,,,

Your and character development can under go a variety of different approaches to enhancements focusing on different disciplines and armour styles that determine your combat approach.

I'm not even past the first part of the story yet!
So much content and not in the sense of collecting impossible amounts of a thing, its hidden treasure troves, treasure hunts, side quests that are interesting (at times).
For example, I found a missing persons contract, hunted down her body because the wolves ate her and dispatched the wolves but then the animals that laid dead lead me to a hidden shack which is also where i encountered two bears with red skulls above their names. That was when panic ran its course as i had previously exhausted my food rations (when dispatching the wolves; there was a lot), so i ran around the house because it was locked and found a cave entrance that is the right size for me but small for the bears and without even checking whats inside i ran in (all the way in) and thought i was safe but that was when i heard a growl and Geralt said Werewolf all calm like while I'm thinking about how I'm gonna get past the bears outside and that is when I reloaded to a checkpoint before i took the contract and went to level up.",,Swig_Kang,,,

In-game story telling is just fascinating. When i start playing witcher i only quit the game because i had to(like had to do something or go somewhere), otherwise i dont get bored at all! Main storyline is good but i think best part is side quests. every other side quest is another story and being in that story is satisfying. Changed my perspective about single player rpg.

I beat the main game on the standard difficulty, and have upped it to the next level for the DLC's, and it's been very enjoyable. I don't know how often this goes on sale, but I remember getting it on one and the DLC was roughly $10 (CAD) this holiday sale, and it's worth it's full price tag, although that's not something everyone can afford to pay.

The leveling system belongs in an MMORPG not in a single player game.  Low reward and extremely tedious.
Combat is hack and slash.  Extremely simplistic with power attacks mostly useless.
The range to interact with things is atrocious.  It doesn't matter how close Geralt  is it's more where you point the camera.  KOTOR solved this 10 years ago.
The devs put candles and fireplaces in lootable areas to prevent players from looting quickly.  Enjoy watching a 2 second cutscene every time you try to loot a bookcase because there's a candle on the table.

Only problem is that the combat is a little too simple.
On the hardest difficulty, you win any fight by casting quen, then dodge, attack, dodge attack, if you mess up cast quen again. One way to sort of break this up is to spec almost exclusively into your signs, but that just adds the extra step of spewing fire every so often. You wont really face any challenge in this game.
another combat issue is the inability to jump while in combat, it leaves you in this weird situation where Geralt gets stuck on everything that isn't completely flat while fighting.",7.65612E+16,BIKarus | Razzer Barrazer,,,

There is a very compelling story which gets you right into the lore from the start, even if you haven't played the first two. If the story alone wasn't enough to get you in, you are rewarded amazingly for exploring the stunning open world and completing a vast range of side quests.
The paid DLC are also up to a very similar quality to the base game, and I would highly recommend checking them out.
Side note: The game also performs very well. With high/ultra settings, I maintain a good 60 fps at 1440p (8GB GTX1070, 15-6600K@4.3GHz, 16GB ram). This was also using the HD Reworked mod with 4K textures.",,DocAuz,,,

But back then i often got a feeling of excitement and adventure when starting a new game. Becoming immersed in the story, learning the games mechanics and various layouts or systems.
To me half the fun of these games were the 'unknown' or sense of variety and adventure. Few games ever continued to deliver on that after playing for more than an hour or so!
My library is now stacked with games i barely and never play because they were not games that could deliver that 'wow this game is incredible' feeling.
For years I had lost that feeling, even after trying a myriad of games over multiple genres.
...i just thought it was something i would never encounter again.
Until the Witcher 3.
Over 170 hours i have now put into this and still think it is one of the best games ever created. It was fun, intelligent, challenging (sometimes very), beautiful, immersive and sometimes just plain awe-inspiring. I often would think 'holy ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•... they thought of that too!'... the developers have created a masterpiece, and im sure anyone who has played it would agree.
It tops my list with the original civilization, gta, half-life, c&c back when they all were first released and playing them for the first time. Could put Fallout vegas in the same league as well ;)

It really contributes to the organic feel of the world. I love that cities and towns bustle with people and activity everywhere, unlike other games where major cities are ghost towns.

Without a doubt, my game of the decade. You cant go wrong in this purchase. I would have happily paid full price knowing how good this game was. Having put in 100 hours within 2 weeks. I even have a tattoo dedicated to this game as of recent.
I just wish I could forget this game, so I could play it all over again. Experience it from start to finish as fresh as possible.
10/10. This is true perfection. the base game alone offers 40 hours of gameplay if you're strictly only following the main quests. The side quests contribute something fearsome to it. I have yet to play the DLC gifted to me by a friend for xmas.

-Best RPG I have ever played, any game made ever should use this game as a comparison as it sets the bar high.
-Most beautiful and fantasy like world and graphics, even without mods the color palette they used is simply phenomenal, in 2020 the game still puts other games graphics to shame.
-The Characters are so insanely diverse it with almost no cookie cutter bullcrap and thats saying alot considering how most games are these days.
-The main 2 DLC's are actually both amazing and the second one Blood and Wine is simply the best DLC I have ever played in my entire life.
-The modding community is amazing and has some really awesome mods you can use to make some of the games more heavy rpg elements less tedious and make the game look like it came out in 2025 graphic wise.
-Geralt of Rivia is so damn awesome and relatable in alot of ways, I have never loved a protagonist more, you really can decide to be a good person or a bad one almost all the time which makes it a true RPG in my eyes.

,2020-01-06,FALSE,,,,136.1,1265,0,292030,88,TRUE,"Alright look, The Witcher 3 is probably my favorite game of all time. However.... the controls are clunky, and somewhat feel off. It is hard to describe, but anyone who can pick up a controller or keyboard and mouse will realize that fairly fast. Also, the Roach (if you don't know the witcher, Geralt's - the main character - horses are called Roach) is very buggy, and it is impossible to ride her without bumping into fences and trees every ten seconds if you are trying to traverse dense territory. The horse is not skyrim level buggy, but it is still frustrating. In addition, a lot of the main story feels like fetch quests, only admittedly much more interesting than your average Assassin's Creed fetch quests, and the overall layout is very basic if you were to put it on a board.
So why, then, is The Witcher 3 my favorite game of all time, even though I easily just spent a paragraph listing its flaws? Because these flaws are so negligible that for me, they really do not affect the game at all. The story is immersive, although it is very basic. The emotional connections you make with the characters are there and significant, even if you never even played the other games or read the books (which you should do, by the way, those are also great) or even if you just met that character and will never meet them again. Even some of the monsters have their own distinct characterizations and personalities, and you will feel sympathy and compassion even for those monsters (or you won't. It is an RPG after all, so what you feel is up to you). The game feels more than a game, it feels like an entire world that is working inside of your computer. The trees are lush, the landscapes are beautiful, the cities (especially Novigrad) are populated and carry a distinct Eastern European Medieval mood with each city and territory actually serving you in-game as you would expect from its reputation (Novigrad is your main hub for trading and economics, while the Velen swamps will hold many monsters for your hunting pleasure and alchemy material gathering). Further, each one of these cities and territories is incredibly beautiful in its own way; the sprawling streets of Novigrad feel like an urban safeheaven on the surface but dangerous as you dig deeper, the swamps of Velen convey a dreary atmosphere, and the Skellige Isles hold a special sense of freedom and lawlessness. Other than the environment of the game itself, the mechanics are also satisfying. As you play the game, you level up according to what attributes you want to focus on in a well-designed skill ""tree"". As you play the game, you learn new techniques to hunt monsters and approach different enemies. You even start to feel like a monster hunter (that is essentially what a Witcher is, a mutant monster hunter) yourself as you can identify monsters based on their tracks and ""crime scenes"" before you even learn what they actually are. The mechanics engulf you, and as you learn them you get further sucked into the world of The Witcher 3.
This game is not my favorite game because it is without its flaws, but because even after criticizing it, I still believe it came out completely unscathed.
10/10, this game really makes you feel like a goat retriever.",,üòäpleasantüòä,,,

(Maybe) Because of this, The Witcher 3 wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Below are some things I got bothered with during gameplay:
1) the character is easily obstructed by anything. It's difficult to move through objects and often I would get stuck between a chair and a table, for instance;
2) the abilities are very limited and the points you get to acquire them are few, which means you don't get to have many abilities (as one would like to). Basically, you have to choose from the beginning if you want to focus on sign (simple spells) - warrior or alchemy. You can't have advances abilities in all three;
3) TOO MUCH DIALOGUE. Sometimes it felt more like a movie than a game due to so much dialogue all the time. No quest was simple and straightforward which sucks because a game should have more action than just story after story.
I don't regret buying and playing it, but I believe those points could have been better.

Everything seemed fine during Act 1 and Act 2 since even the secondary Quests where fetched out (besides a few that didn't even work properly). But after reaching Act 3 and learning more about the World of the Witcher it seemed more like I was playing a Mod for the base game from some Atheist Redditor (I'm saying it because there is always an underlying theme). Many quests could have been avoided and where a pointless waste of time - with no additional story given and no secrets to be found, while others wheren't fetched out even nearly enough. At least story and quest wise this was a waste of potential and I felt like - at least in the 3. Act - that the game designer didn't yet know if he was going for an ""Destiny"" like RPG. The map design itself was detailed and overall well done, but there where many crates, barrels and other stuff that was clipped into each other - and that was a frequent mistake. Another point of wasted potential was the Visibility of the surroundings - since the character is in the middle of the screen - taking up a great deal - and the camera movement didn't allow for much visibility besides the essentials, you wheren't able to enjoy the map for long. Besides that everything felt sort of out of place and proportion. Objects close seemed closer then they where - while objects at a distance seemed further away. The movement itself seemed forced and didn't allow much precision and freedom - probably to make it look more realistic but failing because of bugs, AI and map design.",,‚ú?Viking,,,

What it is is a great piece of work. It's massively expansive, my first playthrough (Didn't play through steam) took me 130+ hours and that was before DLC arrived. The lore is fantastic and if you enjoy a mild RPG (The choices aren't massive in regards to good or bad, but there's a lot of choice on how to handle a lot of the main quests) that will suck you in for hours this is the game for you. On top of this the game is fantastically optimised and ran extremely well on my PC back in 2015, but even better now on my new PC. Looks amazing too.
It's regularly on sale for 15 with both DLC's (Which are just as worth it) so you can't really go wrong. The biggest and best advice I have for anyone starting is to spam the dodge button until you see an opportunity. Lots of people get caught up failing at the combat early because they try to spam down their opponent but it's all about playing smart and waiting for the right moment, there's even a little joke about it in the beginning of the game.

In combat your mouse has almost no reason to exist, with the right settings you could probably even play the game without it. This game might be really good, but am I buying a PC game, then I expect PC controls, and this feels far from it.
This issue would drive me nuts to deal with through the entire game, and I did search but found no mods or other fix to help with this.
In the end this has left me frustrated and sad, that such a great game, can feel so awful on PC. (Also if you disagree or have any information about this, feel free to comment! ^^)",,tystys800,,,

You really don't even need to use heavy attacks because they just leave you open for attacks and you will rarely need to use signs because you can just hop around the enemy and that is  really all you can do because if you try to stop doing something while in combat you'll just get hit because of how bad the block system is, if you stop blocking for a moment then try to block again the game takes a second for it to register that you are blocking resulting in you getting hit or dying and for 40% of attacks in the game blocking can STUN YOU so its just better trying to dodge attacks than trying to block or parry and don't use automatic slomo kills in group fights because you still can get hit anyway.But in in order to not make this review 3 pages long on how unpolished the combat in the game is: if you are looking for a smooth combat/fighting game like you see in trailers this is not it but if you are just interested in movies/books/series go ahead and have fun.

Now, I've started the second book, finished the Netflix series and am going strong at my first play through still!(I'm playing on Death March (hardest difficulty)) The world Witcher Immerses you in is absolutely brilliant! Nothing is impossible, there is no race or creature that does not exist. This fantasy world is done so marvelously you almost forget its not real. Each character, quest, city, land, book, creature, everything has great depth and detail and makes sure you make use of all the tools at your disposal. Not only that, but even the quest never truly feel the same as most RPG games nowadays eventually do. You're always encountering or hunting different monsters sure, but each one has its own story that just hooks you further into the game. Side quest are actually fun and the main story, thus far, has been amazing. The pace feels nice, its very interesting, Geralt is an absolute beast and as I said before, it just does a fantastic job at taking you into the world of Witcher because even though it does have all the generic fantasy monsters such as werewolves, vampires, trolls, you get the picture. It has many of its own monsters and places each of them in them same world beautifully. The level of immense depth put into the lore and world, everything is done wonderfully.

The game is extremely well polished, meaning that I have not experienced many bugs at all with the fair amount of play-time I have.
When I initially bought the game, I had not played any of the other Witcher games or read the books, but the story was well explained and clear which I quickly grabbed on to. The story itself was so immersive that I found myself playing long into the night just to find out what was going to happen next. The game is also pretty long spanning around 80 hours if you just rush the story, but with all the other side quests, monster contracts and guent games its probably around 200 hours long; so there is plenty to do once you have finished the main story.
When the game's main story finally ended I grew sad that there was to be no more of it, this showed just how much I loved this game. Concerning gameplay, such as combat, even at the lowest levels the game is challenging, but once you go up to death march difficulty, the game is extremely hard comparatively to a souls game. Also the main protagonist, the legend himself Geralt of Rivia is one of my favourite characters in a game. He's serious, humorous and romantic all at the same time. The Witcher world is extremely beautiful, places like the Skellige isles, Toussaint, Kaer Morhen and the cities such as Novigrad, Oxenfurt and Beauclair are truly magnificent.
I would also recommend the two main DLC for this game, being Blood and Wine, and Hearts of Stone. Blood and Wine being my personal favourite, adds an entire new area to the map, this being the extremely pretty Toussaint, the boss fights, enemies and main characters in this DLC are extremely well done and the story itself spans about 10-15 hours.
In Conclusion I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who is interested in fantasy style games, it will go down in game history as one of the best ever, and one of if not my favourite game of all time.",7.65612E+16,max,,,

With the Role-Playing Game genre of this game, you can literally be who you really are. Either acting like a jerk to people or being really nice to people, it affects your progress and all.

The story, graphics, voice acting, side quests are amazing, second to none. That being said the only problem I had was a massive game ending decision is random and you'd never spot it.
Outside of that the combat is by far the most frustratingly bad designed combat i've ever seen. Check my achievements I finished the game on death march, rarely using anything other then food to regen health, it's boring, clunky, repetitive and just plain crap.
If you can get past the the giant crapfest that is the combat, the story is amazing, the side quests alone are worth it, like I said some of the impacting choices are stupid, it's done to show the Witcher is a lesser of two evils kinda guy, it's pretty much the bases for the whole game but it really shows up in some of the 'choices'",7.65612E+16,DaHedgehog27,,,

*****FINAL VERDICT*****
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.... Is there anything bad to say about this game? No... Not really. CDPR Put a LOT of work into this game to make it the complete masterpiece it is. This Series spans over several amazing books and I think that CDPR did them complete justice.
The Gameplay here is phenomenal at the very least. The way you travel really causes you to wander off very often and really promotes exploring, the fighting/control scheme of this game works very well and I think many other developers of this type of game should take note. The mechanics could be explained a tad more but they are easy to figure out.
The Visuals here were absolutely perfect for when this game released, however today in now 2020 I do think could use some work however there are many different options for modifications that are easy to do to solve this problem.
You can REALLY form this game to many players by adjusting the difficulty from super easy to making Dark Souls look like a piece of cake. Along with those things depending on how much of a completionist you are, you could easily put 100+ hours into this game without really even noticing it. There is SO MUCH content here to explore and none of it seems mundane. Gwent is a blast to play and side missions all have a good sense of depth to them.
Just to touch on bugs and glitches... Its hilarious when Roach spawns on the roof of a house and SUPER frustrating when you can't interact or pick up an object due to small tolerances.
All-In-All This game is a 10/10 ESPECIALLY when you factor in that it is on sale all the time. I think I spent $15 on the game w/ all the DLC and generally I consider a game to be worth it if you get a hour of fun for every dollar you spend which this game did much more than that.",,purgatoryexotics,,,

And that soundtrack, OOH! Instant eargasm. One of the best things about this game is that the side quests are actually GOOD! That's right.  Like, for example I was walking around in a city and I saw this old woman crying so I talked to her and she was sad that her house got taken over by monsters or something so I agreed to go take care of it. Standard ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô?go here, kill that, quest right? WRONG! I get there and there's no monsters, there's like booby traps everywhere and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, and then you get into the house and you're old buddy who's a witcher is hiding out there because he's on the run and then people that are hunting him find him and you kill those scouts, then go and kill his friend that ratted him out, then he has this like elaborate plan of faking his death or something. Like DAMN! THAT'S how you do a side quest holy ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Like, you can really tell CdProjectRed put so much thought and attention into every singe facet of the game its amazing. I heard some people complaining about the combat. ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô?WHAT? Combat's fine u just gotta get used to it. I love it, everything about this game is just perfect.

,2020-01-05,FALSE,4,,,182.2,1329,2,292030,57,FALSE,"I don't recommend this game but if you want to play it
1. Install some mods, in particular the ""HD Reworked"" mod for higher quality textures, the ""Aqua"" mod, and the ""High Quality Faces"" mod. You'll find all these and more at nexusmods.
2. Consult guides as to what you have to do in order to avoid the ""bad ending"". Anyone acting compassionately and responsibly has a high chance to run into the ""bad ending"".
The game has a LOT going for it (space restriction prevent me from listing the ""pros"") but the big ""cons"" points are:
A) formulaic quests
B) boring combat
C) unsatisfactory dialogue system and cut-scene heavy
D) ""playing on the mini-map"" syndrome
E) control issues
F) ending selected based on a hidden judgement of player choices which cannot be called anything less than idiotic.
A) If you love walking around in medieval towns and/or love the genre you may never get enough of the game, but for everyone else the quests become repetitive as there are only a limited number of templates that are replayed over and over again with changing text but otherwise identical mechanics. Even focusing on the main quests becomes boring after a while.
The latest Assassin's Creed and Tomb Raider games and ""The Witcher 3"" are pretty much the same game with different content. The overall design (quest and inventory management, weapons and ability-tree management, etc.) is pretty much identical. This design makes most sense in Assassin's Creed because the narrative has a ""simulation"" underpinning. In the other games, including ""The Witcher 3"", a lot of the control is not integrated into the world, thus taking one out of immersion.
B) Very simple tactics suffice to win fights so combat mostly is not a question whether one wins but only when. I don't get why game designers feel that grinding an enemy to defeat is fun. Repetitively going through the motions of some fighting mechanics as dictated by the enemy is at most a chance to display endurance or commitment; it isn't really fun in itself. The challenge, if present which is rare, is figuring out the game idiosyncrasies for that particular enemy as opposed to cleverly using intuitive controls. One example is fist fighting which is incredibly hard at higher levels but becomes trivial once one figures out the ""correct"" way to dodge (there are multiple ways to avoid punches but only one of them is considered to be ""correct""). At the standard level being clever with potions etc. does not pay off. Standard (read ""boring"") button mashing works just as well. There is considerably lag which makes it pointless trying to be be more sophisticated using parrying, etc.
As usual, managing weapons is mainly a chore as one does not need enemy-specific weapons. I found useful weapons early on which meant that i) new weapons only meant that I needed to find a place to get rid of them and ii) the ""legendary and priceless"" sword I received as a reward in a quest turned out to be lower quality than what I already got. One loots and finds a ton of diagrams for weapon construction but never ever were any of these helpful for me.
C) Most of the dialogue choices only offer ways to prolong the dialogue (receiving more exposition and/or background information) as opposed to keep it as short as possible. One can rarely influence the outcome of a dialogue. Some choices are misleading in that they suggest for instance a mellow response while Geralt will actually still deliver some d*ck remark. The dialogue mechanics feel clunky as they are reminiscent of 1970's computer menu systems.
There is an over-reliance on cut-scenes for exposition and dramatisation of encounters. These scenes can drag on extensively and are even annoying to skip through (after reloading a snapshot) because of the high number of individual sequences one has to skip through sequentially. At times, ""playing"" the game feels like watching a movie.
D) One often has to use the mini-map for navigational purposes. Instead of taking in the great scenery on the main display, one is focused on a small map display, slavishly following an outlined path. Of course one could turn the mini-map off but the game is simply not designed to be played without the main aids that i) destroy immersion and ii) reduce the challenges to pretty boring activities. There is one part in the game where the mini-map is not helpful and one is supposed to find a path oneself. Since the task was manageable (which it normally isn't) it was actually fun to do the path finding. I don't object to navigational aids but most of the game challenges should be manageable without artificial aids that take away from immersion.
E) Some of the key bindings cannot be changed which forces one to change mouse controller mappings instead of simply changing the in-game key bindings.
Worse, the ""E"" key is overloaded with actions. It is used for igniting candles/fires/etc., looting, fast travelling, mounting the horse, talking, and so on. This means one will inevitably run into situations when one will loot a box next to a fast travel post instead of activating fast travelling, mount the horse instead of talking to someone, etc.
Looting itself can be extremely frustrating because sometimes Geralt has to maintain a very specific distance and angle to a lootable item in order to activate the looting option. It can sometimes take quite some time until one has positioned Geralt in a way that one can eventually loot something. This makes absolutely no sense if there is only one lootable item in the vicinity but a pretty frequent source of frustration.
The horse is also a pain to use as it often gets stuck somewhere and cannot even jump over the tiniest of fences. It also takes a long time to approach Geralt after being called, which forced me to either run towards it or just forgo using it as running a certain distance can be faster than waiting for the horse to arrive, mount it and then clumsily navigate it over bridges, etc.
One cannot access the ""Inventory"" page while ""shopping"" which means that if one discovers that one wants to sell or dismantle something Geralt is wearing, one is in for a very tedious, exit shop dialogue, enter inventory, exit inventory, enter shop dialogue again cycle. This is most annoying.
F) There are five choices that influence the ending of the game. One has to get three of them ""right"", i.e., choose them according to what the game designers felt made one worthy of avoiding a very frustrating ending. The problem is that a compassionate and responsible player will easily only get two ""right"". That's because out of the other three, two are not defensible at all and one is very debatable. In one of the choices the player is supposed to support a childish destructive action which is a knee-jerk reaction based on bad evidence. It turns out that the little circumstantial evidence there is pointed to the wrong direction so anyone making the ""wrong"" choice (from the ending's perspective) is subsequently validated by the game in terms of the factual decision but penalised with respect to the ending. The other two significant choices are pretty much equally problematic as the theme is that one has to pander to
as opposed to
.
I like the fact that there are a lot of shades of grey when it comes to ""moral"" in the game and I like that some of the decisions not necessarily have the intended outcome. This makes the game realistic and interesting. However, it is simply unacceptable to deny the player a well-earned pay off at the end due to some idiotic ending selection mechanics. I got a good ending because I came across a discussion that alerted me to the problematic mechanics when I tried to find out whether a decision I made was relevant for the game's progress. I would have been livid, if I had run into the trap set by the game designers.",7.65612E+16,teakay42,,,

While 1 and 2 were both 'on a rail' games that heavily focused on the story of the witcher, part 3 has made the brave choice to be an open world instalment and wow! Does it do it deliver! The graphics are stunning, the world is not only vast, but vibrant and filled with character and activities.
The combat system has had some tweaks in this instalment and most of them are improvements. I feel like the targets aren't quite as predictable as in W2 and the targeting system has been vastly improved! The only drawbacks for me are the removal of the fast attack and the camera shake/enemy hit reaction that made you really feel like you were in the battle. While these attributes did make you feel like a god in W2, I still prefer the combat in W3 more.
Finally the improvements to weapons and armour. The amount of combinations in W2 were very limited and you were always left wanting when finding a new upgrade to move to, but in W3 the options are vast!!! Along with a whole host of standard base armours, you also have witcher school armour to collect that gives you some crazy bonus stats upon set completion.
On the whole, the witcher 3 is a well put together game with a massive amount of end-game possibilities and quests. The only complaint I have is that the story doesn't quite feel as involving as the first and second instalments and some of the mission problem solving elements involve basically walking around a party looking for a person that always seems to be the last person you arrive at, or searching multiple barrels or boxes for an item that, again, seems to be in the last one you look in. If you're going to make a puzzle, make it actually challenging, don't just make it about us watching the same cut scene 5 times while Geralt taps a barrel and says ""Hmm, seems full"".
That being said, the game is really satisfying to play on the whole and the expansion packs add a literal ton of new content!!! I've pumped a few hundred hours into this game and I've still got a fair amount of content to go. Get the GOTY edition when it's on sale, it's probably the most hours I've put into a single player game since final fantasy 7!

Even the NPC's on side quests are developed into real characters you just might see again later.  Not to mention the trolls, who made me belly laugh every time they open their mouths.
The graphics are beautiful, the music feels just right, there world is detailed beyond expectation.  Not to mention that the content goes on forever.... every DLC feels like a full AAA game onto itself.  I did not want the game to end, and it really never felt like it would.
The combat is not overly complex, but gives real variety and options to every fight.  All to often AAA RPG combat is just a button mash to see who has the bigger stats.  Here finesse and preparation are rewarded, with care you can overcome enemies much higher level than you.  It all feels rewarding.  The character and gear systems give similar options in how to set up your character, with out being to overwhelming when you with endless (and meaningless) stats.

His army of elves
At his hooves did they revel

Broke down my lute
And they kicked in my teeth

While the devil‚Äôs horns
Minced our tender meat

And brings you to mourn

He thrust every elf
Far back on the shelf
High up on the mountain
From whence it came

He wiped out your pest
Got kicked in his chest
He‚Äôs a friend of humanity
So give him the rest

That‚Äôs my epic tale
Our champion prevailed
Defeated the villain
Now pour him some ale

But while you might be presented with 2 choices and expect one to be right, and one to be wrong, you are instead presented with 2 ""right"" or 2 ""wrong"" choices, and only find out later which of the 2 was which.

All dialogue is voice acted, every single line on the screen, from narration to minor NPC interaction and background chatter. On top of this, the music and sound effects, when played with headphones, Dolby Surround or DTS is mind-blowing.
I've played slowly, exploring, taking every secondary quest and Witcher contract I can and have just finished the main storyline in a little over 120 hours. Watching my friends speedrun the game, I feel they're missing out. I probably have another 50 hours left to play in the main game plus a 100 hours more in the two DLCs combined - they're basically individual stories in their own right. I intend to go for completeness; this game is worth my time and attention.

First, I'll note that I'm pretty picky when it comes to controls, movement, menus, etc. There are plenty of great games out there, and I don't like spending time on a game if simply moving my character is annoying. If things like finicky controls don't bother you, you'll probably love this game.
Much of the game is walking around. This alone wouldn't be terrible if it weren't for the frustrating movement. Moving a short distance or turning around in order to pick things up from the ground can be infuriating. Simply turning the camera to look at an item isn't enough to highlight it. You have to face your character in the proper direction. But, somehow pressing the direction you want to face isn't enough. I often have to press the analog stick four or five times to get it to register my input. Other times, my character walks in the wrong direction altogether. When I finally manage to get my character facing in the right direction, he walks right past the item and I have to repeat the entire process again.
The tutorial system is perhaps the worst I've seen. Every single menu insists on telling me about a dozen different concepts and keybindings. Even though about 1 in 10 are actually useful, they're probably best disabled.
Ultimately, I'd rather just read the books.",,yaks,,,

Currently, as of this review, I'm still doing side quests and taking the main quest slowly. I am enjoying every single bit of this game but it wasn't always like this. Coming from a Skyrim player who played the game multiple times with the same build over and over again, I was hesitant to try this game and have always wondered why it was Game of the Year. Recently, I decided to try it but wasn't amazed by it since I always kept comparing it to Skyrim. It was stupid of me to compare it whilst still being in White Orchard. After watching the Netflix series, I decided to keep playing and I fell in love with the game.
Of course since I played Skyrim with a lot of mods, I decided to mod the game too before I played it.

It works very well with keyboard and mouse, which was delightfully surprising to me. The open exploration, adventures, and vast world filled with new discoveries and amazing creatures is what really gets to me.

Hell yes!!!
Where to start? the story line is amazing. I have played this game through three times already and always manage to find some quest that  has not yet been done. Their attention to detail even in the smaller quests make for a fun and interesting play. They even make collecting items fun, especially with their card game 'Gwent' (best quests ever).
Choices also matter. The way you play changes a lot towards the end. Nearly every  choice has a long-term impact. Forget comparing it to Skyrim, you can't just run around being a bad person or it will bite you. The same goes for being a good person too.
When it comes to game mechanics, the battles are more than just swinging swords. everything comes into it including awesome dodges, parries, kill cams, potions and spells. The game mechanics are paired closely with logic in battle. Each monster has a guide to its strengths, weaknesses and extra information which makes for a different strategy for every foe.
This review is not even the tip of the iceberg. Just play it yourself, you won't regret it.
Anything else?

Read a lots of reviews and most players got like 300+ hours playtime which surprises me a lot, I was scared that I wouldn't understand the story of it because I've never played the previous Witcher games, the first one doesn't seem fun at all, Witcher 2 looks normal but not really motivated to play it so I just decided to read the synopsis so I could understand more of it. After 60+ hours finally beat the game and even completed the DLC Blood & Wine but still a lots of side quests left, like damn there's so much you can do in this amazing game. There were parts I had to cry and there were parts I really had to laugh, I really could feel the story.
Graphics are insane for 2015, it still looks amazing and gorgeous, I even installed some mods to make the game look even better. Story is breathtaking, characters are amazing and really beautiful, the bond they have is beautiful, combat is really fun and challenging, and the world is so big that you have to spend so many hours to explore everything. I'm so glad I have played this masterpiece, unfortunately there won't be a Witcher 4 since it is the end of the saga, but that doesn't mean that I will quit with this game. Once I'm done with doing the side quests I will start a new game plus+ to experience the story again, I won't ever forget this game, it is surely one of my favorite games of all time!
